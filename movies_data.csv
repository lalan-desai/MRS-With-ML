Rip Meeting the Dwarf,1896,Not Rated,01 Sep 1896,1 min,"Short, Fantasy",William K.L. Dickson,Washington Irving,Joseph Jefferson,"Because many films of the time often consisted of babies eating breakfast, blacksmiths at work or people playing cards, to have a film with a narrative was pretty much unheard of. So when W. K. L. Dickson attempted to create what I believe to be the very first adaptation of the Rip van Winkle story, it certainly felt new and different at the time. Unfortunately, the multi-scene film didn't yet exist at this point and instead of turning out one movie, they had to make eight, and if you read each title you'll know what happens in every one. ""Rip Meeting the Dwarf"" is number two in the serial, following ""Rip's Toast"" and preceding ""Exit of Rip and the Dwarf"". Except the dwarf here is really just a full-grown man hunching over on the ground with a huge beard. In this brief second installment to the series, Rip takes the keg off the shoulders of this ""dwarf"", sets it down, and the two begin an unheard discussion.Like I've said previously, you really can't look at each individual segment and judge them because so little happens that you have to put them together to get the narrative. Even so, the whole serial wouldn't really interest anyone today except for people like me who are interested in the development of the story film.",None,United States,1 win,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJhZjUzODMtZjg4ZS00OTQ3LWFhYjctYzYxZDM5OGNmZWFlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.5,532,tt0000109,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Battle of Santiago Bay,1898,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Short, War",J. Stuart Blackton,N/A,N/A,"I never saw this silent film, so I will not comment about it. However, I read about it's creation, and how it's battle scene was recreated in the 1940s in a documentary on the film - which was one of the first film to use miniatures models for battle sequences. The actual battle of Santiago Bay occurred on July 2, 1898. It is a unique battle because the ships of one of the two fleets were totally destroyed. The victorious side lost only one man (decapitated by a chance cannon ball). The total loss of life was less than that of a single ship that (ironically) was sunk the same day elsewhere. And the real battle did not stir until after the battle smoke cleared.The Spanish American War lasted only a few months. Of all U.S. wars it is the shortest. Most of us recall it for the loss of the battleship Maine, Commodore George Dewey's victory at Manilla Bay (with his famous command to Charles Gridley to ""fire when ready""), and the charge up San Juan Hill by Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt. One may also recall the yellow journalism of Hearst and Pulitzer. But many things were forgotten. Military actions in Cuba by the staff of General William Schafter were terribly botched. There were many dead soldiers due to diseases in the camps. The meat supplies were tainted. To top it off there was the battles over Santiago Bay.The film deals with how an American fleet was able to destroy a Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera on July 2, 1898. Cervera had taken his fleet from Spain in April, and skillfully avoided the American navy. If you remember the business in CITIZEN KANE where a flustered Walter Thatcher (George Coulorous) questions Charles Kane (Orson Welles) about an ""armada"" off the coast of New Jersey, that business is based on the temporary mystery of Cervera's fleet. But his ships were soon bottled up in Santiago Bay, Cuba. Just the after the war began the navy department promoted several commodores. Dewey was one of them, but below him was William Sampson and Winfield Scott Schley. Sampson was a highly respected strategist and tactician, but he was a cold, aloof man who the sailors disliked. Schley was more popular - he had rescued the few survivors of the Greeley Arctic expedition in 1884, and had been at the center of the ""U.S.S. Baltimore"" affair in 1891, which almost caused a war between Chile and the United States. However, he had a reputation of being a sloppy ship commander among his peers, and he had an alcohol problem that would get worse in later years. Sampson made a skillful ship plan for stopping any dash by Cervera's fleet from Santiago Bay. But on July 2, 1898, when Cervera decided to flee, Sampson had been called to a meeting on land with Shafter. Schley was in command on the scene.Using Sampson's plan, Schley did sink the Spanish fleet. As I said, only one U.S. sailor died in the battle. But Schley, for all his competence and dash, did not have a clever statement to say in the battle like Dewey had at Manilla. In fact a subordinate, seeing the struggling Spanish sailors in the waters, made the melodramatic, but decent line ""Don't cheer boys, the poor devils are dying."" Also, despite the heavy death toll of Spanish seaman, by sheer irony that same day a French steamer, Le Bourgoyne, had sunk in a collision off Sable Island in Canadian waters, with the loss of over 560 lives. It was worse than the Spanish fatalities.But the second battle of Santiago loomed. Sampson had struggled to return to the battle front quickly, to take command of his fleet and his battle plan. He came too late, and was bitter about this (he felt that Schley had been sloppy in executing the plan - and Schley probably was). Had Sampson been smart he would have remained quiet and eventually people would have wondered who planned the destruction of Cervera's fleet. Instead he started insisting that he deserved to have the credit for the victory. Schley was not happy about this. He was aware that Sampson was technically his superior due to the pecking order of their promotions (both promoted on the same day, but Sampson's name higher on the list than Schley's), and he was not thrilled by that. Had Schley been smarter he would have said that everyone knew how brilliant Sampson's plan was, and that he was honored to have put it into effect. Instead he said he was responsible for the victory, not Sampson (who was not there). The controversy over Santiago Bay would go on into the next decade. In 1902 a naval court of inquiry decided 2 to 1 that Sampson was the one to whom the credit should go. This looks final, although the ""1"" was George Dewey, who was more impressed that Schley handled the actual fighting. It did not do Sampson any good, as he felt humiliated that he needed to go to court to get credit for his strategy. He died in 1902. Schley never fully recovered either. His alcoholism worsened. It did not help him that Schley Land in norther Greenland that his friend Adolphus Greeley had ""discovered"" in that 1884 expedition was proved to be non-existent by Commander (later Rear Admiral) Robert Peary. Schley became (with Greeley) a persistent critic of Peary's Arctic reputation afterward, and a supporter of the claims of Peary's rival Dr. Frederick Cook. But he was finished and died in 1911. The actual tragic-comedy of the REAL battle of Santiago would make an interesting military movie. Unfortunately nobody has ever seen fit to tell it on screen.",None,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.6,45,tt0000173,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suddenly, in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears and surprises the astronomer. At the command of the Fairy Queen, who suddenly appears, Satan vanishes; she awakens the astronomer and as he goes forward to meet her she disappears. The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent. She first seats herself, and the astronomer puts his arms out for her, thinking perhaps he can reach her, when she disappears and in her place there stands a marble statue of a man. The astronomer, in his efforts to reach her falls to the ground. Rising and seeing the statue he is so incensed that he grabs a club, and as he is about to crush the statue it suddenly becomes alive. The large moon again appearing to his view he throws himself into it, and the moon, winking one eye, proceeds to chew him up. The moon's large teeth are seen to sink into the astronomer again and again until he is reduced to small pieces, when piece by piece he is ejected from the moon's mouth and lies there, one piled on the other. Suddenly in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears, but the Fairy Queen drives him off again. She proceeds to pick up different parts of the astronomer and hurls them across the room, and piece by piece they take their proper position in the chair, until the astronomer is again seated as he was before. Suddenly he comes to life again. He moves forward to grasp the Fairy Queen, when suddenly she disappears. The scene is again laid in the astronomer's observatory, the astronomer sitting at the table, asleep over his volume, which he has been studying.""",None,France,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmMwZTIwYTEtNDcxZi00NThlLWE2YmYtZmZlNGQzYzZlMDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5MTU2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,7.4,"4,597",tt0000211,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'affaire Dreyfus,1899,N/A,04 Nov 1899,13 min,"Short, Biography, Drama",Georges Méliès,Georges Méliès,Georges Méliès,"In a series of short docu-drama episodes, director Georges Méliès portrays the events of the Dreyfus affair political scandal which lasted from 1894-1906. First, Captain Alfred Dreyfus is accused of treason to France when his hand-writing is discovered to match that of the Bordereau. Sent to Devil's Island, the unfortunate officer spends his time within the Palisade outside his prison, until he's put in leg irons due to innuendo published by an anti-Dreyfusard newspaper. Around the same time, Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, who admitted forging evidence against Dreyfus, commits suicide in prison by the means of a razor concealed in his luggage. Because of this, it is now decided Dreyfus must be tried again in Rennes, where he is reunited with his wife during his imprisonment. Then, several weeks before the trial, the defense attorney Fernand Labori is attacked by an anonymous anti-Dreyfusard attacker who was never identified. Thankfully, he survives in time to present his case. Finally, since the anti-Dreyfusard claims are still at work, the second trial again results in condemnation; and because the eleven-part serial was made seven years before acquittal, the director never managed to entirely depict the entire story. A lot is left to be desired after the final installment ends.",None,France,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRhNjMwZmUtNGUzOS00YmMwLTk4NjgtYjczNjkyYTU0MDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzUyMjQ3NTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.9,680,tt0000218,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY BLIND MAN is a pretty simple and straight-forward prank film as a homeless man is pushed off a park bench by a police officer. The poor man then puts his outfit on a rich man sleeping in that same chair just to see the officer go after him. AT THE HYPNOTISTS has pretty much what you'd expect from a film with its title as a hypnotist makes a man do various funny things. THE BURGLARS takes place on a rather obvious but funny set as two crooks try to break into a house as a couple cops come after them. DISAPPEARING ACT is a poor man's Melies wannabe as a magician makes a woman turn into a devil then turns it back into a man. The final film, SURPRISE ATTACK ON A HOUSE AT DAYBREAK is without question the most impressive of this group as soldiers close in on another group of soldiers held up in a house. This short, running a brief 50-seconds, is without question the highlight here as we get a pretty good battle sequence that was years before the work of Griffith would come into play. Guy handles the material quite well and manages to make the film feel a lot bigger than it actually is.

Chirurgie fin de siècle,1900,N/A,N/A,2 min,"Comedy, Short",Alice Guy,N/A,N/A,"Turn-of-the-Century Surgery (1900) *** (out of 4) Pierrette's Escapades (1900)*** (out of 4) At the Floral Ball (1900)*** (out of 4)Cabbage-Patch Fairy, The (1900) *** (out of 4)This group of films from Alice Guy takes a pretty big step up from her previous features as not only the running times go up (to a whopping two-minutes each) but they also features more attempts at actual story telling. TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY SURGERY is in the same mode as the films of Georges Melies, although I don't recall seeing anything this graphic from him. We see a doctor use a large knife and a saw to remove the arm and leg of a patient. They then put him into a wheelchair only to have him jump up and dance around. The scenes of the doctor sawing into the body parts is certainly something I haven't seen in any other movie from this era but the tricks at the end, done with editing, are certainly inspired by the work of Melies. PIERRETTE'S ESCAPADES is a nice attempt at hand tinting, which doesn't tell much of a story but we see two women getting ready for something and eventually dancing around. The real reason to watch this short is for the hand tinting, which is pretty ugly by today's standards but I always love watching films that used this early technique. The film ends with the two women kissing on the lips, which might be another first for this type of film. AT THE FLORAL BALL is another hand tinted short, which features two women dancing at what appears to be, as the title says, a ball. THE CABBAGE-PATCH FAIRY will put a smile on the face of anyone who has heard of this tale or in later times seen the actual Cabbage Patch dolls. A fairy, in her cabbage patch, picks a few babies out from the weeds and sits then on the steps in front of her. I'm not sure how good it was to put the babies on the ground the way they did here but this is a pleasant little film that will certainly make you smile.",None,France,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmU0ZWY1MzgtZjQwZS00YzAwLTg1YWMtYzA1YjQ4MjI4NmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM3NjU0MA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.6,282,tt0000286,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AUTOMATED HAT-MAKER AND SAUSAGE-GRINDER comes off as something Melies would do as two men crank their machine to deliver what the title offers. AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S is a decent little comedy as a man getting his picture taken but he can't sit still long enough for the thing to be taken. DANCE OF THE SEASON is a rather ""adult"" film for 1900 as a woman does a little dance while (fake) snow falls on her. THE LANDLADY has a group of kids ringing the bell of a landlady then running off. Then a man comes up and rings it but this time the landlady has some water for him. This group of films once again feature a mixed bag from director Guy as we get some items that were clearly meant to copy other films from other studios. AVENUE DE L'OPERA is pretty good in terms of these gimmick films that everyone was releasing back then. The entire gimmick of running the film backwards was certainly a lot more entertaining back then than it is today but it's still nice. AUTOMATED HAT-MAKER is a straight comedy but one can't help but see more magic would have been worked by someone like Melies. AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S is a decent comedy for its time as we get the annoying man constantly messes up the plans of the photographer. DANCE OF THE SEASONS is perhaps the most interesting film here as there's a brief sequence where someone, using a stick, holds out an attempt at a copyright notice but who knows how well this worked back in the day. The woman's dress is also hiked up pretty high, which I'm sure didn't sit well with many people back then you felt the movies were dirty entertainment.

Danse serpentine,1900,N/A,08 Aug 1900,2 min,"Documentary, Short",Alice Guy,N/A,Mme. Ondine,"This film was included in the three DVD set ""Saved From the Flames""--a collection of mostly ephemeral movies that have managed to avoid turning to powder, catching fire or melting--something that usually happened with the nitrate film stock used up through the 1950s.In the late 1890s, Mme. Ondine created a sensation with her so-called 'Serpentine Dance'--and film footage of this is among the most famous of the early films. Because I am a retired history teacher and cinemaniac, I love early films like this--and it will probably be appreciated by a very small minority of viewers, as it isn't a story, just a lady doing a somewhat mesmerizing dance with very long sleeves. What makes this version interesting, however, is that apparently people loved the dance but wanted something different--and it resulted in an ultra-weird little film. First, a lion tamer enters the cage with lions and does his routine. So far, so good. However, after dismissing the lions, in steps Mme. Ondine into the cage and begins a shortened version of her dance! Huh?!? But, historically speaking, it is really interesting and sure surprised me to see such a film was made.By the way, like surviving copies of ""Danse Serpentine"", this one has some hand coloring. This tedious task consisted of factories filled with women who hand painted portions of each and every cel--which could run into the thousands. And, if that's not enough to exhaust them, they had to do this for EVERY copy the studio released--and you can see why in some cases there were colored and black &amp; white copies released.",None,France,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2EzMjllN2QtYmVlYS00Zjg3LWJmMDAtMmM0ZmZhODA0NjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQzNTQ2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.8,255,tt0000296,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He throws this off in anger, but immediately a policeman's costume flies on him. This is in turn thrown aside in great rage and he finds himself clothed in a soldier's uniform.

Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble.

Then the musketeer breaks the hoop, takes out of his hat a lot of flowers, which he throws on the pieces of the hoop, and by his act he makes a lovely wreath, from which appears a beautiful woman.

Kit Carson,1903,N/A,01 Oct 1903,21 min,"Short, Western",Wallace McCutcheon,N/A,N/A,"This subject is a production upon which was spent a great deal of time and money. It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, ""Kit Carson,"" his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,25,tt0000446,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has no sooner passed the threshold, slamming the door behind her, when a half dozen painted Indians burst into view in close pursuit. Immediately the long rifle-barrel of the pioneer protrudes from a loophole in the cabin wall. It speaks, and a savage leaps into the air and falls clutching the sod. The other Indians slink back, only to reappear an instant later crawling through the grass like snakes and pushing bundles of dry limbs and grass before them. The settler's rifle speaks again and again, but the savages succeed in pushing the combustible material against the house, and in an instant it is fiercely blazing. AN INDIAN MASSACRE [BURNING OF THE CABIN AND MURDER OF THE SETTLERS]. A little girl runs in with the alarm. The door is quickly locked and barred and the long rifle appears at the loop-hole and is frequently fired. The Indians gradually close in on the ill-fated home, and finally have it ablaze from a fire of brushwood. The Indians, now in a frenzy over the success of their fiendish enterprise, procure a log and using it as a battering ram they hurl themselves upon the door and batter it in. The pioneer rushes out to defend his loved ones, but he is quickly overcome and tomahawked, and his wife as quickly meets the same fate. The little girl, terror-stricken by the awful scenes she has witnessed, is seized by the savages and carried off a prisoner. THE OATH! [DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES] In the next scene all that is left of the cabin is a smoldering ruin. A company of trappers come rapidly out of the forest and discover the bodies of the unfortunate man and woman. With bared heads, and in most impressive fashion they register an oath never to rest until they have wreaked vengeance on the Indian murderers and rescued the child. THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL [CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN]. A magnificent scene showing the savages leading their captive along a winding path on the mountain-side. The little girl sagaciously leaves a trail by tearing a bit from her dress. The trappers following shortly after discover the clue and press on in pursuit, encouraged by the knowledge that the girl is probably still living. VENGEANCE [RESCUE OF THE CHILD FROM THE INDIANS]. The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly. The little girl is quickly released from her bonds and, as the picture ends, she is in the arms of one of the brave trappers who have rescued her. All of the scenes in this great production were made amidst the wildest and most beautiful scenery of the Adirondack Mountains, and the subject is one which will appeal strongly to all classes of people.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.2,17,tt0000460,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roles of the slaves are played by white actors in Blackface in an exaggeratedly stagy style. Even the scenes don't tell the story. Instead, they illustrate the titles.As a result, the modern viewer will see this as of little value as a movie. Such a viewer would be wrong.

The Great Train Robbery,1904,N/A,01 Dec 1903,8 min,"Short, Drama, Western",Siegmund Lubin,N/A,Emily Lowry,"The first scene shows the chief as he explains to his followers the plan of the great train robbery. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing.",English,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyMjAxMzEtNzEzYy00MGUxLWJkNGMtZjQ1MjkwY2M5NDk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYwMjAyMzM@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,6.9,534,tt0000487,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coon favors his girl with many presents and lavishes attentions upon her, although it cannot he said that the courtship proceeds altogether without incident. A rival appears on the scene, razors are drawn and finally a duel is arranged, at which both suitors, accompanied by their seconds, appear on the field of honor and exchange shots at thirty paces; one of the combatants is carried off the field, while our original hero remains the master of the situation, and the girl, arriving at the moment, is so pleased with his valor that arrangements for the wedding are made at once.

The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a ""line of sweetness long drawn out."" Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a ""Louis Quinze."" The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, ""O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!"" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for ""blues"" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000590,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: ""I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me."" Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: ""All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard."" One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her. He arrives just in time to see her die happy. (886 feet)",None,Denmark,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.1,51,tt0000583,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hart","The scene opens with an assembly of citizens who are harangued by one of their number, whose words have great weight with the crowd, and their attitude of approval shows that Roman misrule in Jerusalem has reached its climax. Heralds now approach and Roman soldiers beat back the crowd to make way for the approach of the Roman Procurator. The scene changes to the home of Ben Hur, who is seen with his sister and mother on the house top. The cavalcade of Roman troops approaches, and to get a near view Ben Hur leans from the coping and knocks down one of the stones thereof onto the shoulder of the Procurator. This is seen and misconstrued by the Governor, who orders soldiers to arrest the inmates; they, after ineffectual pleas and struggles, are carried off. Ben Hur is consigned to the galleys, where he is loaded with chains. Here he signalizes himself by saving the life of Arrias, who publicly adopts him as his son and proclaims him a Roman citizen amidst the acclamations of the assembled crowd in the forum. Now comes the scene in the games where Ben Hur is challenged by Messala, and accepts it, to the great delight of the citizens. The chariots and athletes parade before the dais and in due time are arranged, and the chariot race commences. Three times 'round the ring dash the chariots, and at the fourth turn Ben Hur comes out the victor and is crowned with the wreath, to the great, chagrin of Messala, who is borne on a stretcher, wounded to death.",None,United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3N2QxMzAtNzA0ZS00ZDJmLTk4YjgtZGI0YjNkYjNkOThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.7,730,tt0000582,movie,30 Apr 2013,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The procession passes a restaurant, where two Englishmen, Sir Hopkins and Mr. Jackson, are sitting between the Turkish guests. The two foreigners perceive the strange Eastern performance. The young Mr. Hopkins falls in love with the beautiful Sulejma. He imagines he receives a look from the black eyes, which promises him a great reward if he will exert himself and obtain it. He at once sets to work with all his energy. From a wandering chemist he buys an opiate, his friend takes it and succeeds in putting it into a bottle of wine intended for the caliph's harem guard. When the two eunuchs are sleeping soundly on their guard, the daring young man sneaks into the harem to see if he has understood the black eyes right. His appearance creates great consternation among the ladles of the harem. He has just made sure that he did understand the language of the black eyes as the caliph appears, and for this time puts an end to his impudence. The two sleeping eunuchs are imprisoned, and the new guard is cautioned to keep a sharp lookout. The lovesick young man keeps his aim in view. That which cannot be gained in one way, must be obtained in another. He buys a basket and some clothes from an old woman, and disguised as a basket woman he easily gains admittance to the harem. This time he is more successful. Sulejma sends the slaves away, gets into the basket and permits the courageous young man to carry her away. At the city gateway the fugitives are overtaken. The pursuers are close by, and Sulejma cannot run as quickly as necessary. A Turk is just passing by with two horses: quick as lightning Mr. Hopkins pounces upon him, throws him to the ground and jumps into his saddle. Jackson helps Sulejma on the other horse and off they go. Jackson stays back, prepared to sacrifice his own life, rather than let the caliph outside the city wall. He shoots the caliph and then sinks down, shot by one of his pursuers' bullets. His and the caliph's death have saved Mr. Hopkins' life and that of his sweetheart. The consternated guards lose their senses and forget the pursuing.

Carelessly they stroll about the primitive forest, only depending upon their strong nerves, sharp sight and excellent guns. Although they are only pursuing one object, the lion, they cannot help admiring the wonders of nature, and to stop now and again to look at the superfluous splendor and the wonderful animal creations of the primitive forest. They see hippopotamus resting lazily by the riverside, and the monkeys jumping about in the labyrinth of creepers. Just look! they are catching hold of one of them; the little fellow does not like the touch of the white hands. There comes the ostrich, watching, and there the timid zebra is running away. But in the primitive forest great dangers are lurking. It is no jest to lie down to sleep here in the animal's kingdom. As the evening sets in, a fire is lighted, the two hunters go to sleep, and the servant is to keep watch: but even a native requires rest, and while the fire is quietly dying away, he too is falling asleep. A roar penetrates the quietness of the tropical night, the hunters awake, seize their guns and give fire. They are quite close upon the lion, and the picture shows one of the hunters shooting at the king of animals in perilous proximity. The efforts of the courageous hunters are crowned with success. One moment later we see the hunter by the lion's dead body. Once more the little party is tracing a lion. This time it is also a magnificent male lion.

He is paying special attention to Kitty, and as she is unable to conceal the passionate love she is bearing towards the Baron, it is not surprising that the Baron, one evening as he is fetching the two sisters from the music-hall in his motor-car, asks Kitty to marry him. Neither the sad circumstances in Kitty's home nor the obstacles which his family and friends of rank try to throw into his way, in order to make him give up this marriage, can induce him to desist from his purpose. He keeps his word and marries Kitty. Two years later we find a happy home; a sweet little girl seems to be an inviolable tie between man and wife in this unequal marriage.

He is persistent in his suit for her hand, but outside of a seemingly cordial friendship the lady apparently does not return his affections. There is a reason for this. Osman Bey, a Turkish nobleman, desires the hand of this charming girl. He has expressed his love for her to her father, who is an ambitious, worldly man and who aspires to obtain that social recognition which is so dear to the average man of wealth. Mons. Dupont is well aware that he is selling his daughter, and so cleverly does he arrange matters by pretending that he is facing financial ruin, that he persuades Flora into giving her consent to the marriage in order to save his credit. Several months later, whilst sightseeing in Constantinople, Jack by accident meets Flora, who is driving in a closed vehicle. He is startled at the change in her appearance and indignant over the revelation of her misery and ill-treatment. Almost a prisoner in the house of Osman Bey, she is denied friends and relatives. Her one great desire now is to get away from her tyrannical and brutal husband. Jack determines to aid her, and tells her that he will gain admittance to the grounds of the palace after sundown, where he may talk with her and if possible formulate a plan whereby she may gain her freedom. True to his word Jack is on hand at the appointed time, but is unable to pass the guards at the gate. Nothing daunted, this daring American determines to scale the massive walls, which he does after a great deal of difficulty. Making his way through the beautiful gardens, he manages to see through a lighted window Flora's face and form, Gently tapping on the pane of glass her attention is attracted, but a female spy, ordered by Osman Bey to keep an eye on his wife, observes the signal from the window and immediately acquaints her master with the knowledge of his wife's indiscretion. Burning with rage, the infuriated husband summons his slaves and orders them to take the American prisoner. Jack has just greeted Flora, when he is startled by a sharp word of command, and turning suddenly he is seized by the stalwart slaves of the palace and dragged away. Flora appeals to her enraged husband for Jack's release, taking all the blame on herself, but to no avail. The prisoner is carried to an underground dungeon, where he is left to ponder over the perplexing situation in which he now finds himself. Maddened by grief, the poor girl determines in her desperation to go to the Sultan and beg his clemency. Escaping from her chamber window she makes her way to the Sultan's palace, and gaining admittance is granted an audience by his majesty. Struck by her beauty and fired by the crafty thought that he might gain this helpless woman for his harem, he promises her the pardon, but instead of letting her take it he dispatches one of his officers with the papers, at the same time commanding the bewildered Flora to remain at his palace. How Jack is led out to execution and how the pardon arrives just in time to save his life, much to the chagrin of Osman Bey, is all vividly shown. Jack has learned of Flora's detention in the Sultan's palace, and so embittered is he at this outrage that he joins the cause of the revolutionists. The last scenes of the picture show the attack on the Sultan's palace, and the meeting of Osman Bey and Jack in a hand to hand conflict in which the Turk is bested, which is followed by the rescue of Flora and the capture of the despised Sultan.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000611,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The venom clamors of a jealous woman poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth,"" and a fury of furies rage as Gay escapes and the maid is discharged. At the office, as his typewriter, is a veritable Andromeda, whose radiant beauty makes him her sycophantic Perseus, and often while her lithe digits are galloping swiftly over the ivories of the keyboard he cannot resist seizing them, and the trend of his dictation becomes a mellifluous flood of ""silly nothings."" It was during one of these effervescent ebullitions that Milady Gay enters the office. Convulsed with rage, she goes for the indecorous couple, throwing Gay into his chair; and driving out the pretty typist, hurling her cloak and hat, with execrations, after her. Poor Gay. Explanations and excuses are futile. The Mrs. will engage the next typewriter, and at out she goes in quest of one to her own fancy. Gay takes advantage of her absence to meet the evicted charmer and together they go to a lobster palace to soothe their ruffled nerves with a cold bottle and a hot bird. But unelusive wifey is on their trail, and he has barely time to get under the table when she rushes in. His hiding place is discovered, and sardonically brandishing a huge china plaster, she brings it down upon the shell of his cerebrum with a jolt that loosens his teeth and raises an excrescence the size of an egg. Meanwhile the cause of the trouble has flown, and Gay is led crestfallen back to the office, where the new typewriter awaits him. Merciful heaven! What a sight. Hecate, the witch, is a nymph of loveliness compared to her. A fact that is an affliction and a figure like a Chinese idol. Installing her in the position, Mrs. Gay, with an air of satisfaction departs. Gay makes an effort to tolerate her presence, but it is simply impossible, so dispatching his office boy to the costumer's to procure the ugliest mask in his stock, he persuades the new amanuenses with a generous bribe of bank notes to go; go and never return. The modern feminine Eumenides, quite overcome by this magnanimous munificence, accepts the money and is off. The boy arrives with the mask, and a message is sent for the charmer, who returns and dons the mask during wifey's calls, which scheme works like a charm. Mr. Gay next visits his favorite manicure shop, and while the pretty manicurist is polishing his nails, persists in playing the game of ""holding hands."" His advances are mildly repulsed by the maid, and during this little pleasantry Mrs. Gay enters and at once recognizing the voice of her hubby, climbs upon a chair to peer over the top of the screen that separates them. The sight she beholds throws her into a frenzy of passion, which causes her to fall from her perch, entangled in the screen and chairs, fighting, fuming, struggling, screaming termagant from whom the trembling Gay and poor manicure girls cower in abject terror. Upon his return home in the evening, he is just in time to see a gentleman, with the courtly bearing of an Italian nobleman, effusively received by Mrs. Gay and invited to her boudoir. Gay's erring soul is torn with jealousy, and seizing a revolver resolves self-destruction, but his courage fails him, and upon sober second thoughts, decides to put his apparent rival out of existence. So following on to his wife's apartment he finds, much to his chagrin as well as relief, that the imagined Barbarello is but an Italian barber, who has come to dress his wife's hair. Sheepishly he retires from the house and an attack of acute dipsosis seizes him. He arrives home in a potulent, boozy condition to find Mrs. Gay, though in bed, is awake to fling at him a most loquacious tirade. Nothing can stop her nerve-racking harangue, until a bright idea strikes the bibulous Gay, and he shuts her up in the folding bed, effectually drawing the curtain over her curtain lecture, and at the same time dropping the curtain on a film story, that for bright, telling comedy situations has never up to date been excelled. -- The Moving Picture World, December 21, 1907","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.8,15,tt0000606,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is his good spirit. When his wild companions are coming for him, she always tries to dissuade him from joining them in their lawless doings, and she never lets him go till he has promised her neither to kill any human being nor any animal. One member of the band, the spiteful Jim, is in love with Clara and bores her with his tiresome declarations of love, in fact one day be sneaks away from his comrades, who are just going out plundering, and returns to Tom's cottage in order to make love to Clara, but as she again refuses his brutal caresses energetically, he leaves her, threatening both her and Tom's lives. His threat soon becomes serious, as he walks straight to the nearest prefect of police, to whom he betrays all his companions and offers to guide the soldiers, who are sent in pursuit of the robbers. In a hollow way in the wood the soldiers hide themselves while Jim steals away, and when the robbers unsuspectingly come strolling uphill, they plunge straight into the lion's mouth. It now comes to a close fight between the soldiers and the robbers, during which two of the latter are killed by the soldiers bullets while Tom, after a desperate combat, is fettered and carried away along with two of his companions. Clara, who in a mortal fright has followed the wicked Jim, unfortunately is too late to warn her friend, but she now catches sight of the fleeing Jim. She lies down behind a tree root in wait for him, and by the time he is quite near to her, she jumps forward and stops him with her revolver. When the rascal realizes that he is lost, he tries once more to kiss her, who by her faithfulness towards her friend, has turned himself into a miserable traitor, but he again fails, for Clara is a good marksman, and her bullet kills him. Clara now has avenged herself and Tom, who however is lying in the jail upon a bundle of straw with his hands tied behind his back, while the soldiers are keeping watch in the adjoining room. Yet this hindrance is of no consequence to Clara, who has but the one purpose of releasing her friend. With a basket full of bottles containing narcotics she is admitted into the guard room. The soldiers get drunk, Clara steals the keys and sets her lover free. They both succeed in escaping through the guard room but in the street they are discovered by an officer and a soldier, and although Clara attacks the enemy with the courage and wildness of a tigress, she at last must save herself by taking to her heels. At dusk Tom, in close custody, is carried out into a carriage with his bands still tied behind his back, in order to be taken to the prison in town, but he does not get as far as that. Clara lying on the highroad behind a heap of stones in wait for the carriage, and when same approaches, she springs forward, mounts the carriage steps, seizes the soldier by the throat, till he has lost consciousness, then she throws him into the carriage and releases Tom, with whom she flees into the wood. At a lake she washes the wounds of the half-unconscious Tom who by her help drags himself along to a farm, where Clara threatens the farmer into giving her two horses and after a wild ride, during which Tom is hardly able to keep himself in the saddle, the two fugitives reach their cottage. Shaking with excitement and exhaustion they enter their home, where Tom sinks into a chair, while Clara kneeling before her wounded friend tries to console and encourage him. The pretty picture of a faithful wife's devoted love is, however, abruptly disturbed by a strong noise outside the house. The poor lovers full of despair start to their feet, and at the same moment the shutters are burst open by the soldiers' guns. Once more Clara makes an attempt to save her friend, and the fist soldier who enters the room is killed by her bullet, yet the superiority is too overwhelming and a few bullets make an end of the faithful lovers' struggle. Even at the moment of death the brave Clara uses her last strength to drag herself on toward the dead body of her friend and press a kiss on his pale lips. -- The Moving Picture World, April 4, 1908","None, Danish",Denmark,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFhNzFlOWQtMzUxMi00N2Y0LTlmOTItNDE1NzdjZjc4NzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM2MjYxNjQ1._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.6,39,tt0000617,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several caribou are shot and taken in the course of the hunt. The excitement reaches a climax when one of the animals is run to the beach, and as he stands sniffing the air, a well-directed shot takes effect.

Nordisk led the world in film technique for the first decade of the 20th Century, until the national industry imploded and moved to Germany. But this short, simple melodrama -- girl loses boy, girl dies of a broken heart -- is possessed of advanced techniques in several fields: restrained acting, careful, beautiful compositions, fine camera movement -- there is one overhead traveling shot that is gorgeous -- even set design: people live in furnished houses, with flowers on the table, not something that shows up in most films for another decade.

Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific Ocean, the vessel is wrecked and all on board are supposed to have been drowned, at least so the newspapers chronicled. What a blow this was to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, still she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, ""Robinson Crusoe,"" for he at least enjoyed the companionship of ""Friday,"" but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child.

The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.6,67,tt0000642,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffith,"Linda Arvidson, Florence Auer, Edward Dillon","The daughter of a staid New England minister is brought up in absolute ignorance of the ways of the outside world, and, when she gets the slightest inkling of its glamour, it makes a decided impression. Into her hands have fallen several theatrical newspapers, and she and her girl chum eagerly digest their contents, recounting in glowing terms what seems to be a golden existence. So wrought up were they that they immediately give vent to their ebullient spirits by indulging in a quasi-dramatic performance. This is a scene of broad burlesque, and, during its enaction, the minister enters and is greatly shocked, not to say incensed. A stormy scene occurs between him and his daughter, which ends with her leaving home. She applies for a position in the chorus of a New York opera company. What a contrast she makes at the trial of voices, but with determination she pulls through the ordeal and is accepted. Owing to her sweet face and manners, together with a beautiful voice, her rise in the profession is rapid. Still, she has found that all is not gold that glitters, and while her artistic success is most agreeable, life for her is empty, cold and cheerless, made more odious by the appearance of the inevitable vile, flattering tempter. Numerous letters has she written to her dear old father, but no response, for he has torn them into shreds before he even broke the seal. ""Oh, God, if I could only go back. If this all would prove but a dream."" But, no, there is the dark fathomless future before her. The tempter would have her go with him, and there seems to be no alternative. She is now surely at the crossroads of life. She makes a final appeal to her father in a telegram begging him to come to see her performance on the night following, which he does. Down the aisle of the theater comes the old minister in bewilderment, so unaccustomed is he to the surroundings, as through the peekhole in the curtain drops the girl views the scene in ecstasy. After the performance the old man makes his way to the back of the stage, where he once more folds his daughter to his heart, while her would-be lover views the scene with unconcealed chagrin.

'Tis the opening night of a big production at the opera house, and at eight o'clock we still find the distracted actress in her humble apartment bending over the wan figure of her little one, while her own mother stands by in mute distress. A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.5,63,tt0000644,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Betrayed by a Handprint,1908,N/A,01 Sep 1908,9 min,"Short, Crime",D.W. Griffith,D.W.

During the evening bridge participated in by a number of the guests, among whom is Myrtle Vane. Miss Vane is playing in wretched luck, and is advised several times by Mrs. Wharton to desist, but she still plays on in the vain hopes of the tide of fortune turning, until at last, in the extreme of desperation, she stakes her all and loses. Shame and disgrace stare her in the face. What can she do to recoup her depleted fortune? As one of the guests there is Professor Francois Paracelsus, the eminent palmister, who of course, was called upon to read the palms of those present. Sheets of paper were prepared and each imprinted their hand on a sheet to be read by the erudite soothsayer at his leisure, and so were left on the drawing room table. All have now retired to the apartments assigned them by Mrs. Wharton, but there seems to be a sleepless night before Myrtle, and she suffers mental agony, until the thought of the necklace flashes before her mind's eye. 0, if she only possessed those treasures all would be well. The more she thought of it the more unconquerable became her covetousness, until the inimitable determination to secure them seized her, but how? To enter her room by the door would not only arouse the hostess, but maybe the guests as well. There was but one way, by the window, and this undertaking was decidedly hazardous, for it meant that she must crawl along the narrow ledge between her window and that of Mrs. Wharton, a distance of twenty feet, and one slight misstep would result in her being dashed to death on the walk below. But when a woman will, so she makes the trip without mishap, entering the room she searches noiselessly for the top of the dresser, finds it, secures the necklace, and makes her way back to her apartment. Now to hide the jewels. An ingenious idea strikes her. She cuts in two a bar of soap, and hollowing it out, places the treasure inside and joins the parts together. Meanwhile Mrs. Wharton, aroused from her slumber, intuitively looks to her diamonds, but finds them gone. ""What's this? A clue!"" On the dresser there is a sheet of the palmister's paper on which there is a handprint of dust. Down to the drawing room for the corresponding imprint. There it is, and signed ""Myrtle Vane."" To Miss Vane's room goes the furious Mrs. Wharton, and during the scene that transpires the soap is brushed from the table and breaks open, exposing the necklace, at the same time convicting the poor girl. Upon the recovery of her jewels, Mrs. Wharton's anger subsides and she is inclined to be charitable towards the unfortunate girl kneeling at her feet, so she not only forgives her, but insists upon aiding her financially.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg3ZmZkMGYtOThlOC00ZDFhLWEyYWQtNWQ3OGE3NjQyYjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.0,182,tt0000645,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Her one hobby was to possess a hubby. Many there were whom she tried to hook, but in vain, for truth to say. Arte was of pulchritude a bit shy. She had the complexion of pale rhubarb and a figure like a wheat sack. Still her motto was ""nil desperandum,"" and she was ever hopeful. One thing in her favor, her father. Obediah Stebbins, avowed his aid. Of the visitors who called at the Stebbins' domicile, Hezekiah Horubeak seemed the most probable to corral, so Artemisia set to work. Hez at first was a trifle recalcitrant, but was soon subdued by Obediah's gun, which we must admit possessed egregious powers of persuasion. The day for the wedding was set, and to the village church there flocked the natives to witness this momentous affair. All was progressing serenely until the all-important question was put to Hezekiah, and instead of answering ""Yea,"" he kicked over the trace and tried to beat it. His escape by way of the door was intercepted, so it happens that the little church is in sore need of a stained glass window, for Hez took a portion of it with him in his haste. Out and over the lawn he gallops with the congregation at his heels, Artemisia Sophia well in the lead. Down from the terrace onto the road they leap and across the meadow until they come to a fence, on the other side of which are two boys shooting crap. Over this hurdle they vault coming plump down on the poor boys, almost crushing the life out of them. Regaining his equilibrium, Hez forges on coming to the very acropolis of the town. The descent therefrom is decidedly precipitous and makes Hez hesitate for a moment, but only a moment, for the howling horde is still in pursuit, so down be goes in leaps and falls to the bottom, followed by a veritable avalanche of human beings. Owing to this mix-up Hez has a chance to distance them a little, and being almost exhausted, he attempts to climb a tree, but too late for the gang is soon upon him, and carry him back to the church where the ceremony is started again, and when he is asked that all-important question he fairly yells, ""Yes, b'gosh!""

The little one asks her mother if Santa Clans is coming, to which the poor, almost heartbroken woman is unable to answer. The baby then says, ""I'll write him a letter to be sure to come."" And so she writes on a scrap of paper, ""Dear Santa, please don't forget little Margie. Me and mamma ain't got no food even. Little Margie, 114 Broome St., top floor.""

When the little one is asleep, the mother takes the note, and reading it, is driven almost mad with helplessness. With the child's missive clutched in her hand, she takes up her cloak and hurries to the pawnshop, which is presided over by Mike McLaren, an Irish pawnbroker. Mike's reputation as a philanthropist is not very pronounced. On the contrary as we see him he appears to be a cruel, pitiless Hibernian, without a grain of charity in his makeup. Ah! but who can reckon the power of the Christmas spirit. Mrs. Martin enters Mike's place and proffers her cloak as a pledge for a few cents, but Mike throws the cloak back at her with an invective. It is worth nothing to him, so he will allow her nothing. In her mental agony she absent-mindedly drops the baby's letter on the floor. Mike picks this up alter she leaves. What a change comes over him as he reads the child's innocent appeal. Hustling his clerks about, he bids them buy a Christmas tree, ornaments, toys and provisions. This done, he enlists the service of a couple of burglars, who burglarize Mrs. Martin's apartment, slightly chloroforming her and her child, so as to be sure of their not waking while they are at work. In comes the clerk with the tree and presents, which Mike arranges, and when finished, he goes out into the hall to watch the effect.

They were the fastest of friends until a young girl appeared and by the workings of cruel fate was beloved by both. Now the golden woof in the weave of friendship becomes badly tangled, as we shall see. The girl has given her heart to one of the classmates, unknown to the other, who meets her for the first time at the football game, by the way, a most spirited scene, showing the team's quarters and then the actual game, which is undoubtedly the finest ever photographed. The graduation exercises follow and are attended by the highest dignitaries of Church and State, prominent among whom will be seen President Roosevelt, Bishop Potter, Seth Low, etc. This is followed in time by the graduation ball, during the course of which there is a confetti dance. This, without exception, is the most beautiful scene ever shown in motion pictures. As the dance progresses the dancers are showered with a veritable blizzard of tiny stars and ribbons, producing an effect simply indescribable. It is during these festivities that the youth confesses his love for the girl, and is plunged into the depths of despair when told that her heart is another's, his chum. How coldly do the classmates part, when the next day they start on their divergent paths of life. The unsuccessful suitor to the West, where he engages in mining pursuits, and the other to the metropolis of the East, becoming a successful financier, the owner of fast horses and, above all, the liege lord of the fair charmer.

While the trio are enjoying a pleasant chat over old times, an urgent message calls the husband to his stable on account of the illness of his most valuable racer, leaving his wife to entertain his chum until his return. The chum takes advantage of his absence to renew his protestations of love, which are spurned by the wife, who, when he becomes persistent, attempts to avoid him, mounting the stairs leading to the upper floor. He follows, whereupon the wife, with a well-directed blow, sends him reeling down the stairs, crashing through the balustrade to the floor below, just as the husband reenters, amazed at the sight. The woman's denunciation of the false friend brings about a terrific combat. About the room they struggle, smashing furniture and bric-a-brac to atoms, until the husband lands a powerful blow upon his adversary, dropping him like a log.

Ah, but the Devil knows how to play the game, and his promptings are so fascinatingly impressive that few can resist. But who is the Devil? He is the embodiment of our evil inclination warring with the pure. So it was that at his prompting the artist falls, as does his model. They are discovered by the wife, who in turn is prompted by the Devil to ""get even,"" which she heeds. She is surprised by her husband in a private dining-room of a café in company with a gentleman friend. In frenzy he leaps at his wife's throat, and the Devil laughs. He would have sent her to him then and there, hut for the intervention of the waiters. In terror, the poor woman rushes to her home. She is followed by the crazed husband. In vain she pleads, but the Devil prompts: ""Kill."" Taking a revolver from the dresser-drawer, he moves deliberately toward the terrified wife, and the Devil laughs. A shot and a body and soul part; another shot, and ""There was the Devil to pay,"" and he collected. This subject, while thrilling, is most ingeniously handled, with photographic quality of the highest order, showing a stereoscopic effect never before attained.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.5,45,tt0000672,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She notices its absence while seated at the banquet board and is very much wrought up in consequence, but Mr. Brown assures her that she will find it safe upon their return home. As one of the guests, there is a party named Wells, who, unknown to all, is a gentleman burglar. Hearing of the forgotten necklace, he sees the chance of a rich haul, and feigning illness, leaves the banquet hall, makes his way to the Brown apartments and is just about to decamp with the loot, when the Browns return; so he hides behind the portieres that cover the window, leaving the necklace lying on the dresser. Brown is a bit boozy, and goes out again, ostensibly to procure cigars. While he is gone, Mrs. Brown retires. Wells seizes this opportunity to get out, but hearing the approach of Brown, compels Mrs. Brown to hide him, or he will pretend to her husband that he is her lover. Here is a dilemma. Well, she conceals him in the closet. Brown enters, and taking off his coat goes to the closet to hang it up, and it looks for the moment that a discovery is inevitable, so Wells sneaks from there, and after ineffectually seeking a place of safety for some minutes, is finally caught. He throws suspicion on poor Mrs. Brown, who in vain tries to convince her husband the fellow is a thief. Finally the husband hands her a pistol and commands her to shoot her lover, or thief, whichever he be. This the wife is loath to do, but as Wells raises a gun and is about to shoot her husband, she sends a bullet through his wrist, dropping the gun from his hand. At this moment a couple of policemen, who had heard the skirmish, rush in and secure Wells, in whose pockets are found many articles of value, proving conclusively his true character. Brown now shamefacedly implores the forgiveness of his wife for his suspicious.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.8,64,tt0000665,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Falsely Accused!,1908,N/A,18 Jan 1908,N/A,"Short, Drama",Wallace McCutcheon,N/A,"Edward Dillon, D.W. Griffith","A wealthy old alchemist and inventor has just perfected a motion picture camera with which he hopes to revolutionize the art of animated photography, and our story opens with the old man in his library studying out the plans of his invention. A telegram calls him hurriedly away. He replaces the papers in his safe, but, in his haste, neglects to lock it, which oversight is pardonable, as his wife and daughter are in the room at the time. The daughter's hand is sought in marriage by a worthy young man, whose attentions are looked upon with favor by herself and her parents. But he has a rival in the person of a contemptible villain, whose motives are purely mercenary, reasoning that this new invention will greatly enhance the father's already ample wealth. He has met with little or no encouragement from the girl, but is determined to have her at any hazard, so calling at the house shortly after the old man departs, is ushered into the library by the maid, who goes to inform her mistress of his arrival. While left alone in the room he espies the door of the safe ajar. Making sure that he will suffer no interruption, he goes through the safe and secures the coveted plans, secreting them in his pocket just as the girl enters. He renews his protestations, of love, but is again repulsed, and when he becomes insultingly persistent, receives a blow in the face and is ordered from the house by the incensed girl. He goes, but swears vengeance. The father now returns and goes to his laboratory to make a final test of his invention. Threading the camera with photographic film, he starts the motor, when the villain enters to lay his proposal for the girl's hand before him. It is, of course, rejected, and the villain threatens the old man, flaunting before his very face the cherished designs, of his invention. The old man, white with rage, leaps at the throat of the villain, forgetting about the camera, which is whirling through its mechanism yard after yard of negative film. During this scene the young girl is in the library relating to her fiancé her experience with the odious suitor, and upon leaving he is assured that there is nothing to fear in that direction. She then goes to the laboratory, and the horrible sight that greets her freezes the blood in her veins, for there upon the floor lays her dear old father cold in death. Bending over his lifeless body she picks up a dagger papercutter which the murderer, whoever he be, had taken from her father's desk. There she kneels beside the prostrate form transfixed with horror, with this poniard tightly clutched in her nerveless hand, when the villain enters with, others and boldly accuses her of parricide. Appearances are unfortunately against her, so she is led away to prison. Circumstantial evidence is so strong that the world believes her guilty and all desert her except her poor old mother and her faithful lover, who visits and consoles her in her prison cell, vowing he will leave no stone unturned to run to earth the real culprit. Visiting the laboratory, the young man makes a startling discovery. While rummaging through the old alchemist's effects, his attention is drawn towards the new camera and although having but a vague knowledge of the art of animated photography, he has, through his association with the old inventor, a limited idea of its importance, and some little talent in chemistry, so he examines the camera and finds that one of the film boxes contains film. This he take into the ""dark room"" and develops a short strip sufficiently to see a faint outline of a scene. ""My God! Just as I thought!"" He hurries with the box of film to the old mans assistant, who develops it and prints a positive. Armed with this convincing evidence, he rushes into the courtroom, and with the permission of the presiding judge, sets up a moving picture machine and projects the result of his discovery upon the wall. The scene here pictured completely exonerates the young girl by showing the actual murder of the old man by the villain, who, during this exposition tries to bolt, but his escape is cut off, and he is taken into custody for the- heinous crime he committed. -- The Moving Picture World, January 18, 1908","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.5,48,tt0000680,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This never impressed old Wilkins so forcibly as when his son and daughter give him the go-by, stamping him as a ""has-been,"" and away out of the game. Even Mrs. Wilkins, who is as vivacious as a widow, snubs him. He keenly feels his condition and resolves to alter it. With this in view, he enlists the services of Professor Dyem, the celebrated Dermatologist and Tonsorial Artist. After a session with the Professor, beheld the transmogrified Wilkins. What a change! Shorn of his grizzly beard, his locks raven, complexion florid, eye clear and step elastic, he views himself in the mirror. He hardly recognizes himself. In fact, it requires his valet to convince him that he is he. ""Am I in it? Well. I guess. If I don't keep up with and even beat that bandwagon by a city block, my name is not Pill Wilkins."" He sallies forth and makes for the park. The first person he encounters is his wife. He approaches her in elation, but she mistakes him for an impudent masher and he receives the weight of her parasol over his head for his trouble. The next one he meets is his daughter. She is seated on a bench, waiting for Charley. He takes a seat beside her and when he tries to make himself known she draws herself up to full height and with a blow sends him backward over the bench onto the grass. Well, he changes his tactics, and gets reckless. Along comes his son with his best girl, so he decides to win her out for spite. Now this young lady has a sensitive pneumogastric nerve, and when he sits beside her on the bench and slyly suggests a cold bottle and a hot bird, she is ""his'n."" This is done so coolly and so quickly, that young Wilkins, who, of course, does not recognize his respected papa, is speechless with rage. He follows them, however, to the café, where his intrusion is resented and he is rudely thrown from the place. At the Wilkins' domicile there is an indignation meeting. Mother, daughter and son all rush in to relate their experiences to father. He is not to be found. Suddenly a hilarious individual enters. ""'Tis he, the insulter: a drunk and disorderly."" They are about to have him thrown out when the valet comes to his rescue and explains that the jubilant gentleman is no other than their dear papa, who has not only caught up with the bandwagon, but is sitting on the seat with the driver.

The little ones, however, in their childish innocence, could not appreciate the odium of their elders, and Bobby Wilkinson and Nellie Caulfield became child lovers. This incensed Colonel Wilkinson, who tore the children apart, ordered Bobby never to be seen in her company again. The Colonel's action ignited the ire of the Caulfields and a furious conflict ensued, resulting in the shooting to death of George, the Colonel's youngest son, a boy of fourteen. From that time on the clans kept strictly to themselves. But love knows no clannishness, and, despite family hatred, Bob and Nellie remained lovers. After ten years, driven to desperation by this apparently insurmountable barrier, they elope and are married. Bob decides to brave the storm of his father's anger and present his wife, but the old Colonel drives him from the house, disowning him. Old Aunt Dinah and Uncle Daniel, the colored servants, were so attached to the young folks that they go with them. Two years later we find the little family, now increased by an infant son, having a hard of it. It is Christmas morning and no turkey for dinner. Old Aunt Dinah, believing in the efficacy of prayer, gets down on her knees in the kitchen to ask the good Lord to send them a bird. Uncle Daniel, touched by this demonstration of faith, takes a gun and determines to get a turkey at any hazard. Over the hills he goes, but his journey is hopelessly fruitless until he comes to the rear of the Colonel's house. Tillie, the cook, has just hung a fat turkey on a post outside the kitchen door. When Daniel sees it he can't resist the temptation. Back home he hustles and finds Dinah still at prayer, he lays the fowl on the floor beside her and sneaks out. When Dinah sees it she surely thinks it was due to her prayers. Well, the turkey is cooked and an old-fashioned Christmas anticipated. Meanwhile the Colonel has discovered his loss and tracks the thief to Bob's estate. Entering, a tragedy seems inevitable, but when the old Colonel sees the young one, his grandson, in the cradle, his heart goes out to it and the feud ends then and there.

Wilson is a bank cashier and has fallen into the error of so many of his kind. As his peculations are detected, and well-grounded rumors already rife, he comes to ask the wise counsel of his friends. Robertson having departed, Wilson hesitatingly unburdens his mind to Mrs. Robertson, who, of course, is amazed at his recital. While they are engaged in whispered conversation, the maid, who has packed her belongings to leave, peeks in.

This she immediately telephones to the police, and while so doing Hendricks awakes and starts off to warn his friends. He arrives at the old deserted house ahead of the police, but escape is impossible, so the police rescue the girls, but fail to secure Pong and Hendricks, who afterwards seize the girl detective, and taking her to the house, tie her to a post and arrange a large pistol on the face of a clock in such a way that when the hands point to twelve the gun is fired and the girl will receive the charge. Twenty minutes are allowed for them to get away, for the hands are now indicating 11:40. Certain death seems to be her fate, and would have been had not an accident disclosed her plight. Hendricks after leaving the place is thrown by a street car, and this serves to discover his identity, so he is captured and a wild ride is made to the house in which the poor girl is incarcerated. This incident is shown in alternate scenes. There is the helpless girl, with the clock ticking its way towards her destruction, and out on the road is the carriage, tearing along at breakneck speed to the rescue, arriving just in time to get her safely out of range of the pistol as it goes off. In conclusion we can promise this to be an exceedingly thrilling film, of more than ordinary interest.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.4,86,tt0000683,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffith,"Charles Inslee, Harry Solter, Gene Gauntier","Bill Preston, a heartless roadabout, too despicable for the association of white men, had gathered about him a little band of low-down redskins, whom he seemed to rule by extreme despotism. At any rate, they all feared him, as he, with them, terrorized the whole country 'round, by acts of pillage, arson and worse. Bill, despite his black nature, was a handsome fellow, who, under different conditions, might be called attractive. This the case, there is reason why Nellie Carson, a girl of the frontier, should fall so violently in love with him, casting her lot with his. She soon finds out his true nature, but even then she seems to be held by an irresistible power, though, he would cast her off, which he tries to do, leaving her lying wounded and insensible in the road, after a stormy scene between them. She is discovered by a girl of the mountains, who offers to help her to her mountain home. Though moved by the girl's kindness, she rejects her offer, choosing to go her own way on the road of life she has picked out. The mountain girl drives off and is waylaid by Bill, who seizes her and brings her to his camp. Nellie, coming along later, discovers evidence of what has taken place, and with a feeling of pity for the girl, and jealousy of Bill, resolves to save her. She arrives at camp at nightfall and manages to release the girl and get away, but unfortunately her revolver drops to the ground, and exploding, awakens the gang. The girl's plight looks bad for the instant, and would have been disastrous had not one of the Indians, who had always shown a weakness for Nellie, handicapped Bill. This enabled the girls, who mounted the one horse, to get a lead. However, Bill and his red devils are fast gaining on them, and several of his bullets have taken effect in poor Nellie's body, who has sacrificially placed herself between the mountain girl and Bill. The girl's apprehension seems inevitable, when the Indian rides up, and Bill, with a dagger wound in the breast, falls from his horse, thereby closing his contemptible career. This in a measure demoralizes the gang, and the girls reach the mountaineer's cabin, but Nellie is mortally wounded and expires as she is taken from the horse, the good Indian driving up just in time to claim her body that he might bury it. This subject is an exceptionally thrilling one, with photography of the highest order, and many of the scenes tinted.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.1,51,tt0000694,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, pretty little O Yama Sum had a will of her own, and casting tradition to the winds, insisted upon making her own choice. The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior. She writes to him to meet her by the Great Lamp of Savatiya that night, and they are nearly caught through the treachery of one of the butterflies of the court, who tells the Daimio of his rival. The lover escapes by hiding in the great lamp and afterwards being conveyed in a large hamper to the Bower of Roses, where he is eventually captured and thrown into the torture chamber. The Daimio, to render his revenge more complete, conveys to O Yama a false message from her lover, with his, the Daimio's, permission to see him. She is conducted to the chamber, and the sight that greets her fairly paralyzes her; for here is her lover hung by the wrists, dangling over a treacherous bed of upturned knife-blades, which inflict ugly wounds at the slightest move of his body. Besides this, there is a sword lying across a fire to be used at order from the Daimio. Here the Daimio gives poor O Yama her choice between her marriage with him or her lover's torture. But the brave warrior urges her to refuse. The sword, now incandescently hot, is applied to his breast, leaving great red scars, but he is still obdurate, until at length he is cut down and expires in the arms of O Yama. As he fails, his dagger drops to the floor, and O Yama, unobserved, conceals it in her obi. Then, turning to the Daimio, she consents to become his bride. He, delighted by her apparent change of heart, orders the preparations for the wedding to be made at once, which, according to Japanese custom, is to take place just before sundown. There in the wedding hall are assembled the courtiers and butterflies, when enter the priest, or ""Marrier,"" as he is called, followed by O Yama, her mother and the Daimio. The Daimio, his bride-elect, and her mother take their places on the cushions, while the Marrier pours the sake, handing the cup first to the mother, then to the Daimio, who both drink of the wine, and finally to O Yama, who, instead of drinking, whips the dagger from her obi, plunges it deep into the heart of the Daimio, who drops like a log, dead at her feet, and before anyone can intervene she performs the happy dispatch with the same bodkin, so concluding a film story that is not only a most exciting and novel one, but extremely picturesque as well.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.4,26,tt0000698,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Johnson, Marion Leonard","Though somewhat obscure in the beginning, this subject shows the efficacy of a mother's prayer. Holy is the name Mother, and many who stray from the path of righteousness to the radiantly alluring avenues of sin and prodigality, are rescued from the inevitable end by her prayers. So it is with the hero of this story. Jose, a handsome young Mexican, leaves his home in the Sierra Madre Mountains to seek his fortune in the States. On leaving, his dear old mother bestows upon him her blessing, presenting him with a pair of gauntlets, upon the dexter wrist of which she has embroidered a Latin Cross. This she intended as a symbol and reminder to him of her and her prayers for his welfare. She cautions him to be temperate, honest and dispassionate: to bear the burden of life's cross with fortitude and patience. We next find him in a tavern on the border, where congregate the cowboys, miners and railroad construction employees, a new line from the States into Mexico having just been started. This tavern is the principal hotel of the place, and as a matter of course there is a motley assemblage in the barroom, which also serves as the office. Tom Berkeley is the engineer of the construction company and the affianced of Mildred West, a New York girl. Mildred, being of a romantic turn of mind, and wishing to cheer Tom's life in this sandy purlieu, consents to join him and become his wife. This is the day of Mildred's arrival, and Tom meets her and her father at the train to bring them to this hotel. Bill Gates, an assistant engineer, has long loved the fair Mildred, but has received no encouragement, in fact his attentions are to her odious in the extreme, for she has seen behind his veneer of gentlemanly civility the despicable brute that he is. Their entrance at the tavern causes quite a stir, for the pretty face or the girl makes an impression on all, particularly Jose. He is silting drinking with a friend on one side of the room, while just across the way is a party of cowboys playing poker. One of the boys takes a roll of money, which is done up in a bandanna handkerchief, from his hip pocket, peels off a five and puts the roll back. The Chinese servant sees this and upsetting a glass of liquor on the floor, gets down, ostensibly to wipe it up, steals the money and drops the bandanna at Joses feet, who upon rising thinks it his own, puts it in his belt and goes out. He has hardly left the place before the robbery is noticed and of course suspicion points to him, which seems well-grounded, upon his being brought back with the incriminating bandanna hanging from his belt. At once there is a cry of Lynch him!"" and although he protests his innocence, and despite the pleading of Mildred, who really believes him so, he is taken out to be hanged. Off to the woods they drag him and placing the rope about his neck they give him one more chance to confess, but still insisting be is innocent, he asks for a chance to pray. As his eye falls upon the cross on his gauntlet his thoughts go back to her, who, no doubt, is now praying with him and for him, through a mother's intuition. Meanwhile Mildred at the hotel is in the extreme of commiseration for Jose, who she is sure is guiltless. Coming from her room she runs suddenly into the Chinaman in the act of hiding a roll of money under the hall carpet, and before he is aware of her presence she has snatched the money from his hands and gained the admission that he is the real thief. Like a flash she is off after the would-be lynches, arriving just as Jose, taking a last glance at the cross is swung in the air. Breaking through the crowd she causes the startled cowboys to release their hold on the rope, and Jose drops to the ground uninjured. A hurried explanation and return of the money to the owner, and all start after the Chinaman, leaving Mildred and Jose on the scene. He cannot express the gratitude he feels for the girl, but swears that if ever she needs his help he will come to her. Taking out his knife be cuts in two the gauntlet and gives her the wrist as a token of his pledge, and as she takes it her eyes sink deep into his heart, enkindling a hopeless passion for her. She in turn promises to always keep his token with her. Time runs on, and Jose cannot obliterate the sweet face of the girl from his mind's eye. She has in a measure usurped that of his dear mother, hence to ameliorate his sorrow, he takes to drinking and goes to the depths of degradation. At the end of five years the railroad contracts are completed and a garden fete is given in honor of Tom Berkeley, the engineer, by the officials. Bill Gates, of course, is present and renews his attentions to Mildred, who is now Tom's wife. She at first mildly repulses him, but when he becomes insultingly persistent, she screams, which brings to her side Tom, who with one blow sends Gates crashing through the trellis work of the arbor. Gates swears vengeance and, going to a low tavern for help, comes upon Jose, drunk, of course, and with him and another greaser they waylay Tom's carriage in a lonely road on their way home from the fete. A blow on the heart puts Tom out, and Gates carries Mildred, who had fainted, to the tavern, where he takes her, assisted by Jose, to the upper floor. Jose then, at Gates' suggestion, goes downstairs for some drink. During his absence Mildred revives and makes a desperate struggle to escape but she is restrained by Gates, and finally falls exhausted on the cot, as Jose returns with the bottles. There upon the floor is the cross-embroidered wrist of the gauntlet, which Mildred has dropped during the struggle. Jose seizes it and the truth at once dawns upon him. ""Oh, God, what have I done? Yet it is not too late to undo it."" So with the ferociousness of a wolf he leaps at the throat of Gates and after a terrific battle drops him lifeless to the floor, as the husband and friends burst into the room. The tables are now turned and Mildred has a chance to thank him for his deliverance. Jose at the sight of the cross makes a solemn resolution, which he immediately fulfills, to return to his dear old mother in the mountains, in whose arms we leave him, concluding a film story that is one continuous concentrated absorbing thrill. -- The Moving Picture World, August 15, 1908","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.9,53,tt0000695,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They take frequent pulls from a brandy bottle on the table between them. The door opens and Mimi, a very pretty girl, thin and pale, enters, carrying a basket of flowers on her arm. She comes timidly forward. Bambard rises to his feet, staggers toward her in a half-drunken manner, points to her full basket of flowers, roughly pushes her and orders her out again. She sinks exhausted on a chair and pleads for a rest, but Bambard strikes her and forces her out the door. The two thieves resume their conversation, and after a while gather some burglar tools, leaving mother Martin, another member of the gang, in charge and depart. The flower girl wanders along to a fashionable part of the city, meeting with but little success in disposing of her flowers. An automobile dashes up, and Rene Masson, a handsome young man, alights. Mimi offers him a bunch of flowers. He looks at her face, takes them and gives in return several bank notes. At this moment the girl is seized with a sudden faintness, staggers and would have fallen had not the young man caught her. He places her in his auto and starts for home. Bambard and Pigord, who have been watching from across the street, start off in the same direction. The young man reaches his apartments, carries in the unconscious girl and places her on a couch. Forcing some wine between her lips, the girl soon revives and opens her eyes in wonderment. She is given food and drink, recovers from her faintness and asks to go. Her protector accompanies her and they have scarcely left the room when Bambard and Pigord enter, ransack the place, carrying away bank notes, jewels, plate, etc. They proceed to their den, tell of their escapade, also of the fainting of Mimi. A plan is conceived to lure the young man to the den and a note dispatched offering to return the plunder for a cash ransom, and signed the flower girl. Rene receives the decoy letter, takes a roll of bank notes, his revolver and departs. Mimi returns to the rendezvous, learns of the robbery and also of the plan to trap the young millionaire and determines to save him. She eludes mother Martin, jumps from the window and hurries to the police inspector, and, with several officers, starts for the gang's headquarters. Meanwhile the young millionaire proceeds to the address given, and as he crosses the threshold, the thieves spring upon him, overpower and bind him. Bambard, after securing the young man's money, points his revolver at Rene's head. As he fires, the door flies open and Mimi jumps in front of Rene and receives the bullet instead of him. The officers follow and after a short struggle the gang is overpowered and taken away. Rene's bonds are removed. He rushes over to the flower girl, raises her in his arms, she looks up with a smile, presses his hand and falls back dead.

But alas, Hulda was a fickle maid, and seemed to have as many phases as the moon, with a smile for all and a frown for none. Her capriciousness was the cause of much unrest, both for herself and her lovers, for when her parents had departed for a visit, leaving her in charge of the kitchen, she received most effusively Jocular Jake, the village cut-up, only to hide him above stairs at the entrance of Previous-Hearted Pat, the hostler, who in turn is hidden in the Dutch oven at the approach of Handy Hank, the chore boy.

At the parish church the worshipers are observed leaving, among them Magistrate Lorenz. Father Herman and Madalene, a charming young girl whom Lorenz has chosen as the wife of his son Rudolph. They proceed to the home of Lorenz, where Rudolph is observed seated on a bench, meditating. The young man is upbraided by the father for his failure to attend religious services, and while in conversation Leah appears, closely followed by the angry mob. The crowd makes a rush toward her, the priest raises the cross before them and they cower in fear. Beneath a large cross in the forest, Leah is waiting expectantly. Rudolph appears and the lovers, for such they are, rush into each other's arms. The young man asks Leah to marry him and leave home. She promises, and after vowing eternal fidelity the lovers part, agreeing to meet the following day at the same place and from there leave for other parts. Nathan, an apostate Jew, has stolen in behind the pair during their conversation, hears all and gleefully departs unnoticed. He proceeds directly to the home of the magistrate and tells of Rudolph's love for the Jewess. Lorenz is furious, will not believe the tale, and bids Nathan begone. At this time Rudolph appears, and being asked for the truth, haughtily admits his love for Leah. The old magistrate is heartbroken, and he and Nathan decide to buy off Leah with gold. Although indignant, Rudolph consents to have her love tested. Nathan leaves with the large purse of gold and shortly comes upon her. He offers her the purse which she angrily throws to the ground and indignantly leaves him. Nathan stands for the moment perplexed, then puts the gold in his own pocket, takes the empty purse, returns in the house, and shows the purse minus the gold. The father and his associates are overjoyed, while Rudolph is heartbroken. The next day at the appointed time Leah goes to the forest and waits anxiously for Rudolph. As time passes on and he does not appear, she falls to the ground in bitter grief at his supposed unfaithfulness. At his home Rudolph is heartbroken over what he thinks her falsity. He goes inside warily with his father, and presently Leah approaches the house, knocks at the door and begs to speak to Rudolph. The father orders her away. Rudolph appears in the doorway, starts upon seeing Leah, and angrily bids her depart. Leah does not understand his changed manner and pleads with him. Rudolph denounces her, then passes inside, leaving the Jewess in agony on the steps. Preparations for the marriage of Madalene to Rudolph are quickly made and they repair to the church for the ceremony. Leah creeps up to the door and hides as the party enters. She watches the ceremony, and as the villagers leave the church, falls in a faint. Again at the cross in the forest Rudolph is as Leah appears before him. She upbraids him for his faithlessness, while he shows the empty purse and accuses her. She at last comprehends the situation and indignantly denies having taken the money. Rudolph also sees the mistake, falls to his knees and asks for pardon. Leah haughtily turns away, tells of her suffering, and, bitterly abusing him, departs. Five years elapse, and outside Rudolph's home he and Madalene and their little child are seated. Leah comes upon the little girl and kisses the child lovingly. The villagers come upon the pair and jeer at the Jewess. The noise brings Rudolph and Madalene from the house, and Leah points to Nathan, the leader of the mob, denounces him as an apostate Jew, a thief and the instigator of her unhappiness. Rudolph shows the empty purse, justifying the charge. Nathan is taken in hand by officers and dragged away.

Woods,Edward Dillon,"Poor Jones plodded along in his wearying struggle to earn the pittance with which to maintain the home, and though often plunged into doleful, dismal doldrums, being of an imperturbable nature, patiently toiled on. Hence it was that he hailed with keen delight the opportunity of taking a day off. No other arrangement was made than to spend the day as one of absolute rest at home. How well he succeeded is most lucidly shown in this Biograph film. It is during May, and we know what transpires in all well-regulated households during this month, and with cruel coincidence, his holiday and general house-cleaning were set for the same day. Jones starts in all right. He takes a fine cigar, the morning paper, selects the easiest chair in the parlor, and assumes for the nonce the air of a gentleman of leisure. But, alas, his beatific dream was rudely disturbed by Wifey: ""John, dear, I really cannot get this stovepipe back in place; it doesn't seem to fit."" Well, we know what a prolix undertaking this is. John struggled and swore, fretted and fussed, until down came the whole affair, covering him with a suit of soot from head to feet. A bath is next in order. Having divested himself of this ebony complexion, he is back in the parlor, but hardly seated, when Mrs. Jones calls him to the kitchen to fix the water pipe. He succeeds only in getting a thorough drenching, and once more a change of apparel is necessary. This being done, his wife now demands he hang a picture. ""Ah, let us alone."" But Wifey insists. A stepladder is brought in and Jones ascends it, armed with hammer and nails, with a large picture frame under his arm. The nail is held in position, and, ""Why, John!"" says Wifey, ""such language, and before baby."" John had aimed the hammer at the nail head, but hit his thumb. Another blow, more vigorous than the first, is sent, ""Gee, whiz, twice in the same place. Biddy Mulligan."" Jones, with a yell of pain, leaps in the air and there is a mad race between his head and the picture frame for the floor; it was a dead heat. Wifey is awfully sorry, and allows him to pacify and amuse himself with minding the baby, a delicate attention on her part. Still, it might be worse, and soon it is, for Wifey's voice is heard calling, ""John, dear, the gas is leaking."" Jones, with a lighted candle, goes into the cellar in search of the leak, and finds it; and when the smoke and dust of the explosion clears away, poor John is seen stretched out on the cellar floor. Oh, but what's the use? John was given a day of rest by the boss, and he rests with a vengeance.","None, English",USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000701,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,

Dillon, Anthony O'Sullivan","Lonesome Junction, though a howling wilderness, possessed one blessing, a train to somewhere else, but like all good things in this world, none are gained without a struggle. So the trains, of which there was but one a day, are never on time. To the station there comes a coterie of weary travelers, all possessed with a wild desire to put a long distance between Lonesome Junction and the backs of their necks. As usual, the train is six hours late, and you may imagine the party is in not a very amiable humor. The first to arrive is an Englishman, who is ""jolly well"" vexed at the condition of affairs. ""Train six hours late! Hit's a blooming h'outrage, don't you know!"" He leaves his suit case in the sway of others coming in, and a wealthy mine owner, who enters at that moment, falls sprawling. The next to enter is a prize-fighter, who in turn takes a tumble. Wow! It looks as if there is going to be ""something doing,"" when the driver of the Pony Express enters with the mail bag, and tells Mr. Pug to sit down and behave. He sits and lights his pipe, still chewing the rag. The driver clips the pipe out of his mouth with a pistol shot and makes him dance to the music of his gun play. This holds Mr. Pug for an indefinite period. The party is now increased by the arrival of Heinrich Spitzelperger. ""Vas ist das; sex stunden zu warten ? Oh, vell, I haf a smoke."" Heine has pipe and tobacco, but no match. ""Please, you haf a match, no?"" Well, it looks as if he don't smoke. At this point the door opens and in rushes one of those hypochondriacal phisanthropists, a Black Hand Dago. A hyena is a playful kitten compared with him. Opening his satchel, he takes out a large bomb, lights the fuse and places it on the window shelf of the ticket office. The pugilist is the first to notice his action and yells, ""Beat it!"" which they surely do, all except Heine, who is seated on a bench still searching through his pockets in hopes of finding a match hidden therein. Espying the smoking fuse of the bomb, he picks it up, ignorant of the danger, lights his pipe and failing to extinguish it, drops it into a fire pail none too soon, for the moment it strikes the water it explodes, blowing Heine off his feet. When the party returns they find him suffering no further injury than badly shattered nerves. While relating his experience there enters a most beautiful young lady. ""Observe who is in our midst,"" says one, and a more chivalrous bunch you never saw; all anxious to serve her. She states that her baggage is outside, so Mr. Pug insists that ""I'm de boy wit de strong arm."" He carries in several grips and finally a trunk as big as a cottage, which completely does him up, and though there is still another trunk, he is not equal to it. Now Heine gives an exhibition of brain vs. brawn, and instead of shouldering the trunk, wheels it in on a hand truck, much to the amusement of the party at the expense of the pugilist. They are all now in high spirits when there appears in the doorway a tough road agent With most forbidding mien he points a revolver and commands them to line up and put their valuables on the floor in front of him. Heine, unobserved by the bad man, drops down behind the trunk and when the thug's back is turned, sticks a gun behind his ear and tells him to drop his firearm on the top of the trunk. Hurrah for Heine, the hero! But he forgets the thug may have another gun, and in the unguarded moment he whips out another and is about to push daylight through Dutchy when the express driver from outside sends a bullet through the bad boy's wrist. The arrival of the belated train is announced, and the party scramble out of the station, in a mad rush to get aboard.","None, English",USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000716,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding that he is to be disinherited by his wealthy parents if he persists in his marriage with this girl, and being in fear of the consequences of not marrying her, from her brothers and father, he lures her to this lonely spot, where he has gone before and dug an improvised trench. The frantic efforts of the girl to get from his clutches and escape with her life are shown, and finally the actual murder. Wm.

The mother of Maria is taken very ill, and during the course of her illness is seized with delirium, in which a dream appears, vividly portraying the actual scene of the crime.

A bitter war is waging between two kingdoms, and as the King and Queen hold court in the throne room of the palace there arrives a courier, who, battered and exhausted, has scarcely strength as he falls at the foot of the throne to thrust into the hands of the anxious King, a message which tells of the disaster and panic that has befallen his forces. The King immediately holds council of war and calls for a trusty messenger to carry to his armies the reassuring intelligence that reinforcements have been rushed to their aid. The lot falls to a brave young courier, lion-hearted and with nerve of steel, who, before setting off, goes to take leave of his sweetheart. He discovers her resenting the unwelcomed advances of his rival, a contemptible scoundrel. The villain departs, swearing vengeance, and shadows the hero as he rides off. The sweetheart, on horseback follows to warn her lover of his danger. Now the villain, with the aid of his mistress, who has arranged a meeting by letter, dupes the hero by lying in the road, pretending she is wounded. The hero dismounts to assist her, and is stabbed in the back by the villain, who had hidden in the bush. He secures the message and they make for a neighboring inn, leaving the hero lying in the road, where he is found later by his sweetheart and her attendants.

This became more torturing as time went on, until at last, when the bank was arranging to ship a large quantity of cash to the West to relieve the recent money stringency, he made up his mind to heed the solicitude of that specter which had haunted him. Listening to the instructions given to the bank's messenger as to the shipment of the funds, he hustles off to a gang of crooks in whose company he had fallen. He tells of the proposed shipment, what express, what time and where to. They are not long in devising a plan, and a most clever one at that. A large coffin box is procured and one of the parties is to be fastened in it in such a way that he can release himself at the proper time.

A blow on the head with the butt of the gun brings the agent to the door like a log. The door is locked. From the agent's pocket he gets the key, opens the door and signals to the crooks who are in waiting. They enter and at once start to break open the box by drilling and blasting the cover. Meanwhile, the agent, who was only stunned by the blow, crawls to his telegraph instrument and sends out a help signal.

John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. God's mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys. Tom and Gladys grew up together, and were child sweethearts, which grew stronger with Gladys as time went on. So deeply did she love the handsome Tom that she put her entire trust in him, feeling sure that he would reciprocate her sacrificial devotion with the honorable obligation it merited. But, oh, how mistaken she was, and only after prayers and tearful entreaties does he agree to marry her, and then only upon condition that she elope. To this she consents most reluctantly, for which act she is disowned by her parents. The villainy that is wrapped up in the black heart of Tom. Truly a marriage ceremony is performed, but it is by a rowdy friend of Tom's, disguised as a clergyman, in fact, a mock marriage.

Not always, but sometimes. Hence it was that the dulcet tones produced by Heinie Holtzmeyer, the fiddler, and Orpheus of the little Holland Village, failed to tranquilize his wife Lena, who was rather a Xantippe than an Eurydice, and Heinie's head, like that of Socrates, often played the target for her pots and pans, and her aim was very good. The poor fellow sought solace at the public house, where he met the toss-pots of the town, and right merry souls were they. His fiddle made him a favorite with all, especially the barmaids, who rewarded his efforts with wine and kisses. His joys, however, are of short duration, for Lena appears, and, brandishing a rolling-pin, clears out the place. Heinie rushes home, packs his bag and, with his fiddle, decamps. He is followed by Lena until he reaches the wharf, where he finds himself, as it were, ""between the devil and the deep sea,"" so he chooses the sea. Jumping into a row-boat he rows to an outgoing vessel, ships and is off for parts unknown. A storm is encountered, and the vessel is wrecked, but fortune favors and he is cast ashore. Heinie is about to give thanks for his deliverance when he is pounced upon by an army of ferocious cannibals, armed with clubs and excaliburs, now wouldn't that discombobulate you? Well, it looked like Stew à la Hollandaise for Heinie. And indeed, the black warriors are about to prepare a Dutch dinner, when the Queen does the Pocahontas act and, throwing herself on the prostrate form of Heinie, declares that they shall strike him only through her. So they desist, for such a thing would be impossible, as the Queen is so thick through, that the longest spear would hardly reach the victim. In fact, she is that obese she looks like a crowd. Heinie now takes his fiddle and discourses sweet music, which places him in such high esteem with the tribe that be experiences his own apotheosis, besides becoming the husband of the Queen and King of the islands. Lena, after three years of relentless endeavor, discovers his whereabouts, and bursts in unannounced upon his sunny serenity. Aha!

Of the thousands who daily witness moving picture exhibitions, the number who have any conception of the manner of making a picture is comparatively small. Therefore, to the majority this picture will prove a genuine novelty. It opens in the private office of the Vitagraph Company, where the manuscript is being carefully considered. The studio directors enter, receive their instructions, proceed to the studio, get out the cameras, give orders about scenery, props, etc. Then we get a view of the Vitagraph actors and actresses making up for their different characters. All preparations finished, the Vitagraph automobiles line up. The performers get in and proceed to the scene of operation, which happens to be, in this instance, a busy city thoroughfare. A trolley is held up, numerous little by-plays, not in the lines, occur to add variety and interest to the picture. This scene over, all hands return to the studio, where we see a stupid actor being put through his work. Next a view is given of the quick lunch counter in the Vitagraph plant. Following this, the studio scenes are rehearsed and photographed, showing all the necessary paraphernalia for the different effects required, as well as the rapidity with which scenes are struck and made ready by the stage hands. The picture finally finished is taken to the testing room, where we see it projected. The Story: ""Love Is Better than Riches."" A young soldier and his sweetheart are sitting in the parlor of the girl's home. The young man proposes and is accepted. The young lady's father enters, is furious when he hears of the engagement, and orders the young man out of the house. He goes, taking his sweetheart with him. They hurry to a church, are married and return to her home. The couple tells the father of their marriage. The old man is beside himself with rage and turns them out into the street.

The young man leaves his wife for a moment, when an automobile dashes along, knocking her down. The auto is owned by her father. The old man gets out, recognizes his daughter and wants to take charge of her when the husband appears, waves him aside and takes his wife to their home.

Patrick Henry McPheeney is Justice of the Police Court of the world's greatest playground. Sunday night is a most busy one for the coppers, and the cooler on Monday morning is jammed with a fascinated mob of law breakers. Quiet reigns as we enter the Hall of Justice, for Bobby, the page, is in the land of nod, while Clarence the cop, who is addicted to the habit of smoking cigarettes in his sleep, is snoring that beautiful sonata. ""Please go away and let me sleep."" Regina, the scrubwoman, arouses them, and Bobby, with the bell, opens court. The first to arrive are Mr. Ignatius O'Brien and Mr. Diogenes Cassidy, the attorneys. The gentlemen are bosom friends and get along together like monkey and parrot. Then, ta-ta-ta-tah! The Hon. Patrick Henry McPheeney enters. He is awfully brutal to Clarence, and snatches the cigarette from his mouth, hurling, yes hurling it to the floor, curse him! The Judge has a large gavel with which he calls the court to order; also using it upon occasions on the heads of the learned attorneys, when they become too demonstrative. The first prisoner to be tried is Happy Hooligan. He is sent up so high it makes him dizzy; next comes Serpentine Sue, the snake charmer, arrested for exercising her subtle contortions on a frankfurter in lieu of the delinquent basket. She is sentenced for life, and should she make it out, is to be hanged. Two small boys are then brought in, charged with having shot the chutes. Diogenes' plea in their behalf brings forth such a flood of tears that the urchins float out on the tide. ""O! Look who's in our midst."" Flossie, the pride of the boardwalk, has been so indiscreet as to wear a sheath-gown and an overzealous cop pinches her: but it is easy for Floss, as his Honor's hitherto flinty heart melts like an ice cream block perched on the equator, and he himself escorts her to her auto. Scrappy Rosenberg and Izzy McManus are next hauled in for prize fighting, so are allowed to give a sample of their talents.

Such is the sad fate of the hero of this Biograph story. Herr Von Mitzel, a disciple of Antonio Stradivari, fell deeply in love with his pupil, the daughter of a wealthy English lord. His love was returned by the fair young maid, who grieved at the disparity of their rank, and wished that he had been more highly born or she more lowly. Oh, the tyranny of fate! What discouraging conditions were brought to bear upon their affections; but true love can no more be diminished by showers of evil-hap than flowers are marred by timely rains; so the conspiring circumstances tended rather to strengthen than to weaken their passion. Now, in the Winter of his existence, we find Von Mitzel alone and forlorn. His only companion and solace is his faithful violin, the strains of which are more eloquent than melodious, conjuring up as they do the recollections of life's Spring-time. We picture him seated at his cheerless fireside, playing his, or rather her favorite selection, and as the sweet tones float out upon the silent night, there appears on the wall a phantasmagorical portrayal of his thoughts, which bring him back to days of yore. The image of his inamorata is first seen; then the lesson on the harpsichord, when he declares his love; next the scene of her being forced by her parents into an odious marriage compact; then a duel with his rival, in which he is wounded. The scene dissolves into the reappearance of the girl. The subject is most beautiful and touching and is sure to win the sympathetic approval of the spectator, besides being a work of photographic excellence.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000732,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, the little cottage is situated near the coast. The waters of the sea have been infested with a band of gold-thirsty pirates, who pillaged every ship that came their way. Having successfully perpetuated one of their nefarious exploits, they are struck by a storm and forced to put out from their floundering vessel in a small yawl, in which they place a chest of valuables, for the shore. Thrown up on the coast by the voluminous waves, they disembark; there are three of them, the chief and two underlings. Taking the chest to a place of safety, they proceed to divide the spoils. A contention arises, and the two turn on their chief, who strikes down one of them at once, but is stabbed in the back by the other, whom he afterwards strangles. Gathering up the treasure, he struggles along, his life's blood oozing from the wound inflicted by the mutinous pirate, until he comes to the cottage of Wilkinson. A terrific storm is still raging and the poor old mother is trying to shut out the force of the gale when the chief staggers in. He begs her to hide the gold, which she does by dislodging several bricks in the fireplace and placing the treasure behind them. This is hardly done when the pirate chief drops dead from the loss of blood and the poor woman is felled by lightning. Hence, the hiding place is seemingly an eternal secret. What a sad home-coming it is for the son, after his success abroad. A year later, however, we find him a happy bridegroom and the sun again shines on the household.

Griffith,Edward Dillon,"Jack Morgan was a handsome fellow, but an outlaw, and although he worked in a most fearless, daring fashion, he successfully thwarted all attempts at this apprehension. Hence it was that the mere mention of his name sent terror to the hearts of the stage drivers of the mountains. Many were the wonderful tales told at the relay inns along the stage route that made the tourists shudder with fear as they resumed their course westward. Dick Stanley was one of the nerviest drivers on the stage line and had, as yet, escaped molestation from Jack, Dick was deeply in love with Mollie, the innkeeper's daughter, but, as our story opens, they quarrel and fall out. At this moment along rides Jack, who, of course, is unknown to Mollie. He asks for a drink from the well beside which the girl stands. The bright, cheerful countenance of Mollie makes a decided impression upon Jack, and it is needless to say that the handsome young bandit, well, it is a case of love at first sight. Jack drives off, and Dick, who has watched the proceedings from a distance, approaches to acquaint her of Jack's real being. She takes no heed of Dick, but is still gazing fondly at the fast fading vision of Jack so Dick mounts his stage box and is off. The stage arrives at a lonesome turn in the road when Jack jumps from the brush and, covering Dick with his gun, orders him to dismount, the passengers to get out and give up their valuables, placing them in a handkerchief, which he makes Dick spread on the ground. Having trimmed them, he orders them back into the coach and Dick to drive off. Then he gathers up and makes off with the booty. Dick drives around back to the inn, gives the alarm, and a posse of mounted cowboys start out after the outlaw. Jack, driven by the pursuing party to the top of a precipitous cliff, deserting his horse, climbs, or rather tumbles, down over the rocks, badly cutting and bruising himself as he goes. Reaching the bottom, he runs through the woods and comes upon Mollie who hides him in the well just in time to elude the pursuers who drive up. She sends them off in the wrong direction, and, when they have gone, assists Jack out of the well, binds up his wounded head with a strip of linen torn from her skirt and gives him her horse, on which he escapes. The cowboys soon find they are on the wrong scent and return just in time to see Jack galloping like mad down the open trail. Here follows a most exciting chase, showing some marvelous horsemanship. Jack has distanced them, but his horse runs lame, and he makes a heroic dash on foot towards a barn. Failing to open the lower doors, he climbs up on a rope to the second story, pulls up the rope and closes the door. The posse now arrives, and a fusillade of bullets is sent at the door, which Jack retaliates, laying out a couple of the party. They at length set fire to the barn, and Jack is forced out through the back, and, as he leaps, a well-directed bullet from Dick's gun sends him reeling to the ground, just as Mollie, who has followed the chase on horseback, dashes up, dismounts and takes Jack's head in her arms only to find him dead.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.7,16,tt0000736,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, to the young wife this condition was most odious. In the grind of household duties, having, from force of circumstances, to do them all unassisted, she was like a flower withering for want of sunshine. Hence it was not surprising that she listened avidiously to the flattering platitudes of the unconscionable tempter.

Hardly has he left the threshold, when the grocer's clerk enters, and is received with an effusiveness most unplatonic.

Stealthily raising the window and lifting the shade slightly, his fears are confirmed. His action, quiet though it be, startles the lovers, who leave the lunch table and hide behind a sheet hanging across the room.

Having just returned from the appraiser's office, and it being late, she puts up at the hotel for the night. In the office at Kate's arrival there is a Mexican woman who has just lost her money at Faro. At sight of Kate's gold she becomes desperate and at once plans to secure it. Kate is shown to a room, and is soon asleep with the bag of yellow nuggets reposing under her pillow. Suddenly the face of the Mexican woman is seen at the window, and she has little trouble in forcing it open. Her intrusion awakens Kate, but she overpowers her and gains the gold in the struggle. Kate manages to fire her revolver, with a view to bring aid, but all too late, for the thief makes good her escape, leaving behind on the door an incriminating mantilla, which discovers the identity of the culprit. A chase is made after the fugitive, the hotel clerk, friend of Kate's, leading the way. This poor fellow, however, is dropped in his tracks by a bullet from the woman's gun in ambush. Distancing her pursuers, the Mexican woman comes upon an Indian girl, who, with her half-breed husband, are camped alongside the river. The Red Girl bides the Mexican woman and throws the searching posse on the wrong trail. In return for the kindly act on the part of the Red Girl, the Mexican woman plies her wiles on the half-breed husband, not only taking him away, but inducing him to kill his wife. To this end they plan a torture. Binding her hands and feet, they take her to a large trunk of a dead tree, which overhangs the river, and here they hang her, like Tantalus, suspended between water and sky. With her teeth she manages to free one of her hands and with an ornament on her necklace contrives to saw the rope and drop into the water. Swimming to the shore she again meets Kate and her friends, and volunteers to become their guide in running down the miscreants, who have embarked in a canoe and are rapidly paddling down the river. Into another canoe the pursuers leap and are soon shortening the distance between themselves and the scoundrels, until at length they come up with them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensues, during which both canoes are capsized, and a terrific struggle in the water ends with the overpowering of the pair and arrest of the Mexican Jezebel. The dip in the river has evidently chilled the half-breed's ardor for the Mexican woman, for he tries to return to the Red Girl, but she repulses him, and we leave her and Kate standing on the cliff, enfolded in each other's arms, bathed in the golden rays of a setting sun.

The pittance realized from the sale does not last long, and poor Ruth is stricken down with the dread disease that carried off her mother. Reduced to poverty, she is forced to send the little girl to the pawnshop with the locket, on which to raise enough to buy a bit of bread. At the pawnshop, old Simonson recognizes the locket, and his heart at once softens, so he goes with the child to the garret, where he arrives just in time to reconcile his lost one when she breathes her last. Crushed and heartbroken, the old man folds her child, his granddaughter, to his breast, which forms the closing scene of a most touching and heart-stirring film. Several of the scenes arc decidedly interesting in the fact that they were actually taken in the thickly settled Hebrew quarters of New York City.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM2Mzc2MTQtYjliMy00M2I4LWJkOTMtOTU1OTlkZDYxYTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcwNjUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.1,138,tt0000752,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three thousand years ago there dwelt in Egyptian Memphis, the ancient capital of the Pharaohs, a wealthy prince, whose wife in beauty was likened to Athor, the Egyptian Venus, with heart as cold as Egyptian marble. The prince, worried and suspicious, seeks the royal seer, who tells him the princess has a lover, and in a vision shows him the princess in the arms of that lover, a Theban warrior. Instant death is the punishment meted out to the guilty pair. The princess is placed on a bier and carried out in front of the Temple, under the very shadow of the Pyramids of Gizeh. Here the High Priest, with a flambeau, sets fire to the pyre and her body is burned as an offering, with prayers, to mighty Osiris, beseeching that he overcome Typhon, who seems to hold sway. Alongside the pyre is placed a vase, decorated with hieroglyphics, which is to be the sarcophagus of that ethereal of the unfortunate princess. The smoke and vapor, as it arises from the body, enters the vase in a most mysterious manner. The vase is then sealed and the cavalcade proceeds with it to the tomb, where it is deposited and the door of the tomb closed, it was thought forever. Three thousand years later there came to the ""Land of Ruins"" a Boston professor, student of the illustrious Jean Francois Chainpollion, discoverer of the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics who unearthed the vase and took it to his home in Boston. Vague, indeed, was the story he learned about the treasure, and while sitting in his study, cudgeling his brain to lift the veil of mystery from it, falls to sleep, and in this psychological condition imagines the maid, while dusting, knocks the vase from the tabouret on which it stands. Bursting into bits, it emits a dense vapor, from which the reincarnate princess appears. Here is trouble. Our friend, the professor, is a married man, whose better-half is a buxom, unethereal person, who doesn't believe in the ""Soul Sister"" tommyrot. She, of course, wants an explanation, which the nervous professor is unable to give, so he bolts and runs hatless out of the house, followed by the princess, both followed by Mrs. Professor. Into a restaurant he rushes, with the princes at his heels. At the restaurant, as they sit enjoying a repast, the reincarnate Theban lover appears and claims the princess. This the old professor resents and is run through by the Egyptian just as the wife enters. Mortally wounded, he falls to the floor, from the sofa, for the scene changes and we find the professor awakening from a horrible dream, the pain of the sword thrust being induced by a severe attack of indigestion.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.8,15,tt0000743,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNhM2JjNDctMmJkNS00YjFkLTk2ZTAtZTZlNWVkMzg3Nzg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI2OTg5ODQw._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.9,27,tt0000748,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coach, arriving at the camp, an alarm is given. and a party of miners start out for the bandits. Sue, who is in deepest sympathy with the handsome young outlaw, starts off at the same time, and, by a short cut, arrives at the shack and warns Phil and Sam of their impending danger.

Phil and Sue are alone in the tavern when the approach of someone forces him to hide behind a curtain. It is Sam who enters and, with violent persistence, forces his odious attentions upon Sue. Things are becoming alarming, when a shot from behind the curtain lays Sam out. Sam, thinking the shot came from Sue's gun, raises himself on his elbow and sends a leaden dart through her which closes the blinds of her mortal existence forever.

He asks for something to drink and he is given wine, which he does not care for, and he is finally given some bottled beer and a glass, but he complains that the glass is too small and he gets a very large sized glass receptacle, into which his wife and maid servant pour the contents of the bottle.

The knight then takes two large rings, a sheet of paper, which he places on one of the rings, then fitting the other over the paper draws it taut as a drum. Two attendants then hold the paper-covered rings upright, another hands a paint brush and paint to the knight, who proceeds to draw a face on the paper. This at a sign changes into a laughing, roguish character. The knight then plunges his arms through the eyes of the figure and draws therefrom bottles of wine which he hands to an attendant who surreptitiously drinks their contents. Making an incision where the mouth is drawn, our knight takes therefrom shawls, scarves and wraps of the finest texture.

Taking off the dresses, they change again to pages; the four become two and vanish from view. The knight takes a ring, ties four ropes to it, and, suspending it in mid-air, calls a page, who sits under it. Then from the ring there gradually ascends a fairy form, who at a sign again descends.

She was indeed the fairest flower that e'er blossomed in the land of the golden sun. At this tavern there stopped the honest, hardy miners and trappers of the neighboring country on their way to and from their claims in the mountains. A sort of a rest-up place for a chat and a smoke with the old keeper, and a mug of ale, served by the fair hands of his daughter. Among those who frequented this rustic hostelry was one of those proletarian half-breed Mexicans, whose acidulate countenance was most odious to all, particularly the girl. On the other hand, her blue eyes, golden hair and sunny complexion inflamed him so as to make bold to kiss her. He is indignantly repulsed, receiving a blow on the face from the girl which sends him from the place, scowling and towering with rage. It is nightfall and the guests all having departed, the keeper leaves for a short jaunt up the road, warning the girl to be sure to lock up during his absence, which she does: then going to her room to prepare for her well-earned rest. She has just removed her waist when there is a knock at the door, and, thinking it is her father returning, she throws a mantilla over her shoulders and opens the door to the Mexican, who had seen her father depart. The cruel, black nature of the brute now asserts itself, and barring the door, he seizes the helpless girl, who screams and struggles until her father, bursting in, engages the half-breed in a fierce conflict, while the girl rushes out into the night. The Mexican having with a blow stunned the father, follows after her. Next we see the poor frail creature dashing wildly and almost aimlessly through the thick forest, coming at last, as morning breaks, to the cabin of her nearest neighbor. Staggering into the place in a state of exhaustion, she relates her experience to the miner's wife, who goes to bring her husband's aid. Hearing the Mexican's approach, the girl hides behind a curtain. In rushes the infuriated beast in search of his prey. While rummaging the place, he is attracted by the childish prattle of the miner's baby, who sits in its cradle playing with her dollie. His heart is softened by the pure, innocent chatter of the child, and he drops on his knees before the crib and prays to God to help him to resist his brutal inclinations. The girl, who Is deeply touched at this scene, comes from her hiding as he rises and is taken by the hand by her persecutor, who implores forgiveness, which is granted, and departs as she takes the baby in arms and kisses it in gratitude, for was it not her deliverer?

Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins are getting ready for an evening at the opera, and. as usual Mrs. Jenkins is tantalizingly slow in her preparations, and is almost carried out of the house by the impatient Jenkins. Baby Jenkins is very much in evidence, and requires a bribe to induce her to remain contented with the maid. This Mrs. J. furnishes in the shape of a papier-maché doggie, the head of which is removed to find its interior filled with candy. Mrs. Jenkins is inclined to deck herself out in her diamonds, and takes the case from the strong-box, but in her anxiety to appease her husband's flustering, she hurriedly kisses baby and departs, forgetting all about the jewels. They are not long in the theater before the thought of the diamonds comes to her, and the awful possible result of her carelessness. She will not rest until Mr. Jenkins takes her home. On arriving there, sure enough her worst fears are apparently confirmed. There on the desk lies the jewel case empty. Good heavens! what's to be done? No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold! there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew. There are many sensational incidents in the course of the film, one showing the curb market of New York is most unique.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.1,19,tt0000767,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stuart Blackton,N/A,Florence Lawrence,"This story of Norway's early history shows Theckla, the Viking's daughter, reclining on a couch in her father's castle surrounded by waiting servants, listening to the music of a harpist, who sits beside her. The door is thrown open, a messenger enters and delivers a message, presumably announcing the return of Olaf, her father. The daughter bedecks herself to fittingly welcome the returning warrior. Passing from the castle to the beach below, Olaf and his followers are just embarking. The Viking is dressed in a costume of the ancient warrior wearing armor and carrying sword and battle-axe He ascends the path to the castle, his men following. Between two of them walks Alfred, a young Saxon prisoner. They enter the castle, where Olaf is affectionately greeted by his daughter, who dismisses the attendants. When alone, Olaf presents the daughter with necklace, bracelets and jewels, the spoils of war. In the guard room of the castle the captive is seated on a bench, with soldiers carefully watching him. The door opens and Theckla enters, with a servant, carrying food and wine. The famished man looks up at the girl gratefully, while she starts in confusion at the manly prisoner. Alfred raises her hand to his lips in thanks for her kindness. At this moment Olaf enters. His daughter lays her hand on his arm, points to the prisoner, and pleads for him. The father shakes his head. At this juncture the high priest of Odin enters, hands a parchment to the Viking, who slowly unrolls it. He reads, ""Odin, the god of war, demands a sacrifice, and the prisoner must be offered up to-morrow at sunrise."" Again Theckla pleads with her father, who shakes his head and points to the priest. He also is dumb to her entreaties, and commands her to leave the room. She rises, staggers and falls fainting in her father's arms. The following morning a procession of soldiers and priests, the captive walking between the latter, start for the temple, where the sacrifice is to be offered up. The prisoner is led to the altar and laid upon it. The priest takes a sacrificial knife from his girdle and is about to strike, when a messenger in terror rushes in and points towards the castle. The priests release Alfred and all start in the direction of the building. Over the rocky path it can be seen enveloped in flames and smoke. The young Saxon has outdistanced the others, and rushes into the burning building before his capturers are half-way up the summit. Inside Theckla is seated on a couch in deep dejection as a maid rushes into the room and excitedly points to the hall whence she has come. The young girl opens the door, but is beaten back by a cloud of smoke and flame. She sinks on her knees, raises her hands to heaven in prayer, then falls senseless on the couch. Alfred rushes in, seizes the unconscious girl in his arms and plunges out again through the flames. At the gate he comes upon Olaf and his followers, and places the daughter in her father's arms. She quickly revives, smiles in her father's face, and turns to her rescuer, who reverently kisses the hand held out to him. Again Theckla pleads with her parent, who grants his daughter's wish, and gives a command to one of his soldiers, who comes forward and gives a sword and helmet to Alfred, hails him as a hero and grants him his freedom. Then Olaf takes his daughter by one hand and her rescuer by the other, joins their hands and raises his own in blessing.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.6,19,tt0000781,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transaction meets with repugnance from the girl. She was entirely contented with conditions, a child of nature, carefree. However, she finds her pleading of no avail, and so pretends to accept the situation. The trapper and Canadian go into the cabin to seal the bargain with a drink, and while inside the girl closes and fastens the door on them and makes her way through the woods to escape. The door fastening proves but a slight handicap, and the trapper is soon in pursuit. The girl comes upon a camping party who give her protection, driving the trapper off at point of gun. The next day, however, the trapper returns and surprising the girl, carries her off in a canoe, beating her into submission. Her cries alarm the campers and the men start off to her rescue. Although armed with guns, they dare not fire for fear of hitting the girl. Finally the trapper, after cuffing and kicking the poor girl, ties her to a tree, intimating that there she will remain until she promises tractability. While in this situation the rescuers approach stealthily and cover the trapper with a pistol, force him off while they release the poor girl. The trapper shows fight and is knocked down and about to be set upon by the men, but the girl seeing her tormentor's plight, at once changes heart, and picking up the pistol turns it on the would-be deliverers, who retire in amazement.

This is all very fine for Phlipp, who is wont to bask in the radiance of her smiles and to sip the honey from her rose-leaved lips. But, alas! his bliss is short-lived, for, the perspicacious Mrs. Phlipp grows suspicious and surprises the erring couple in an osculatory diversion. The meretricious maiden is put to right, and the sinful Phlipp is assailed with most vociferous vituperative verbosity. Storm after storm of opprobrium is hurled at him until with vermiculation his restrained rage bursts forth and he takes his spite, not by ""kicking the cat,"" but by smashing everything at hand. The wife, meanwhile, has gone to the newspaper office to advertise for a Chinese servant malum in se. The Confucian arrives, is put to work, and then the fun begins. His services in the library are dispensed with by the irate husband. Next he visits the dining-room, where a globe of live goldfish excites an appetite which he proceeds to appease. He has devoured several when his piscatorial pleasure is interrupted by the housekeeper, who drags him around the room by his queue, almost pulling it from his cranium. Now, the affairs gastronomic are presided over by a lady who answers to the name of Bridget, is of pronounced Hibernian proclivities, and has a strong aversion for anything yellow. What happens when she meets the Chink throws the ""Monkey and Parrot"" story into gossamer oblivion. They get along so nicely together, baud multum. He resents Bridget's sangfroid with a mouthful of water, spraying her visage as he would a shirt-front. Oh, fury! ""Going down?''

There is a tacit understanding between Bridget and the Cop, so he makes his usual call and is being regaled with hot mince pie and coffee, when the saffron individual returns with a rat in a trap. At the right of the rat the muliebrity of Bridget asserts itself and up on a chair she leaps in terror, while the Cop fans the Chink, who drops the trap. The commotion brings the household to the kitchen in alarm. At the sight of the rat the women mount the table and chairs, while the Cop, hero of the occasion, throws the rattrap through the window, and peace again reigns. All this while there has been reposing within the incandescent walls of the gas range oven, a large succulent turkey, which during the hubbub is quite forgotten, and when the oven door is opened, there is smoke, nothing but smoke, which ends our story typically, as with many seemingly good schemes, this Chinese servant idea ends in smoke, and the Chink, like Othello, finds his occupation gone.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000788,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scarcely has the poor bereft father laid the little one in the ground, when the war cry is heard resounding in the hills. There is an uprising and the chief is summoned to action. Tearing himself from the grave of his little girl he arms himself with his assegai and oxhide shield and is soon at the head of his band of savages, with sinister designs on the Boers. The Boers themselves have become active, and scouts have been sent out to warn those nomadic South Africans who might be on the road. One family, comprising a Boer, his wife and a four-year-old girl, are, however, trapped, and despite extreme measures to elude the merciless black brutes, are soon overtaken. Finding escape hopeless, the Boer leaps from his wagon, and sending his wife and child into the woods, seizes his rifle, in the vain hope of holding the savages at bay while the woman and child seek a place of safety. There is a shower of assegais, one of which pierces the poor fellow, dropping him into the road. Up rush the prancing, jibbing, gibbering barbarians. Finding the man dead, they rush on to find the others. The distracted woman hides the girl in a niche in the rooks, while she goes to find some avenue of escape, but she is at once apprehended and taken by the band to their camp, their chief remaining behind. The baby now comes forward to appeal to the Zulu, who is so reminded by her of his own lost treasure that his cruel nature at once softens as the little one offers her dollie as ransom for her mother. The chief is so moved that he vows to save the mother's life, if it costs him his own. Placing the little one in a crevice in the rocks, where she soon falls asleep, he goes to find the mother. Arriving at the camp, he demands the release of the woman, which his followers grant with protests. Back he goes to get the child, but the wily devils have anticipated him and carried her off. He soon overtakes them, however, and after slaying three in a terrific conflict, delivers the child to its mother, and then sees them safely to their destination. The subject is a beautiful story of parental affection, portrayed in a most novel manner, besides being intensely thrilling.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.0,63,tt0000789,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffith, Harry Solter","There's a lot that's wrong with this piece, but at least there's some life in it as two noblemen fight over a lady -- D.W. Griffith wrote the scenario and his wife starred in it. And there's plenty of movement, as people exit and enter and swing swords and kneel and so forth.The real problem lies in the framing: there is no sign of the Biograph Right Wall, and that lack makes the whole thing look very two-dimensional -- although placing people and objects at the front and rear of the stage does ameliorate this somewhat. The acting is still pretty broad.Still, it is a pretty good movie for its time, 1908, just when Griffith started to direct. But that time would end within a year and the other leading studios -- Edison and Vitagraph -- would also change enormously, albeit in very different ways. By 1912, this would be not an antique, but junk.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.1,26,tt0000784,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thompson's Night Out,1908,N/A,02 Jun 1908,N/A,Short,Wallace McCutcheon,N/A,"Anthony O'Sullivan, Edward Dillon, Gene Gauntier","William Thompson and John Smith occupied offices in the same New York skyscraper, and both being seized with an irrepressible desire to cut loose and paint things crimson, arranged it as follows in this Biograph picture. Thompson sent a message to his wife that his friend Smith was ill, and it was his duty to perform that spiritual work of mercy, ""comfort the afflicted,"" hence he would not have her wait up for him as he might be late. Smith did likewise, using Thompson as the object of his humane consideration. This done, they start off to make a night of it. First they visit the gilded throne room of a temple of Bacchus, where they moisten their parched spirits with dry Martinis. They are soon in a most glorious condition. Smith suggests the show where ""Amateur Night"" is on. Fine! They take a box. Well, what they do there simply baffled the attempt at description. Suffice it to say, it ends with their being thrown out of the place. Now they attempt to lead each other homeward. Smith's abode is reached first. Mrs. Smith is by no means easy or gullible. She hasn't swallowed the ""sick friend"" gag, and is waiting for her lord and master with a rolling pin. After much ado the pair reach the house, with difficulty ascend the stoop, and with a yank, out come the bell knob, wire, etc., followed by the irate Madam Smith, armed with that shaper of pie crust which she uses effectually on Smith's cranium. This is no place for Thompson, so he beats it. At his own house all is quiet. Poor, unsuspecting Mrs. Thompson has retired, breathing a prayer no doubt, for her dear, sympathetic, tender-hearted hubby, who she imagines is even then ministering the wants of his sick friend. Mr. Thompson is in no condition for keys or keyholes, so he adopts other means by which to gain an entrance to his home. In front of the house there is a distinct evidence of some architectural changes in the presence of piles of sand and brick, a mortar box, lumber, etc. These you may imagine are fine for Thompson in his present condition, and he falls victim to them all, finishing with a dive into the mortar box. Taking a ladder he ascends with difficulty to his bedroom window, through which he enters with as little noise as a train of cars. Mrs. T. is awakened. You can readily see what happens, but the worst is yet to come. A policeman has seen Thompson ascend the ladder and thinking him a burglar, follows. In the room the copper is set upon by the Thompsons, who throw him bodily through the window, closing a comedy film we can safely claim to be one of the most laughable ever made.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000773,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photography is excellent and the acting perfect. The subject is perhaps a little strong, but if the spectators do not fancy the different love affairs of Hercules, they are well repaid by the splendid execution of the work. The manufacturers are always most careful in their details, and in this film they do not show us a skeleton for the Hercules, but a fine specimen of physical culture, and they so cleverly distribute the lights as to bring out the forms and muscles of the man. Such films with so easy and natural actions can never tire an audience, but, on the contrary, are pleasing and always well received.

He arranges a dinner at his mansion in which they are all invited. During the day he wrote a letter to himself to be delivered to him when the entertainment was at its height. This letter, purporting to be from his attorney, tells that he has been reduced to bankruptcy by the failure of his agents. Aha! Now we see who his friends are. He was all right while he had it, but now it is different, and they all leave him to his apparent fate, ""So this is what they call friendship. Well, it is as false as sin. But there is true friendship to be found, and I'll find it."" So saying, he leaves behind his life of ease and enlists in the army of the low born. Securing a position as porter in a factory, he sees the other side of life: how those poor devils have to struggle for a livelihood, and yet how honest and open-hearted. None of that cringing deceit of his own set. At the factory there are employed a number of girls. Jennie Coleman, one of the prettiest, is offered an insult by the overseer, and Ross knocks him down for the affront. Jennie's heart went out at once to her protector, and from that time on they were friends, yes, friends, for true friendship is love refined, and purged from all its dross. They were often seen together, and little did Jennie dream of the real being of the man she put her trust in. It was not long before the arduous duties of the factory told on Ross, and he was at last thrown on his back by severe illness. In a poorly furnished room he lies, without those necessities so essential to his recovery. Here he is visited by faithful Jennie, who, finding him without food and other comforts, and penniless, she leaves him and repairs to a hairdressing establishment where she sells her wealth of blond hair, her crown of beauty of which she was pardonably proud, and with the proceeds purchases food and medicine. When Ross sees the terrible sacrifice the girl has made he deeply regrets going so far, and prays for life and strength to return materially this friendship. He is granted his wish, for they are married, and at the conclusion of the ceremony she is transported into what to her seems fairyland, clothed in gorgeous raiment and bedecked with jewels, with lackeys and servants in attendance.

The Valet's Wife,1908,N/A,05 Dec 1908,N/A,"Short, Comedy",D.W. Griffith,D.W. Griffith,"Mack Sennett, Arthur V. Johnson, Robert Harron","Reggie Van Twiller was the typical New York twentieth century young man, who lived his life free and untrammeled by the mesh of the matrimonial net. He resided luxuriously in bachelor apartments, surrounded by a coterie of agreeable companions. His social duties were that exigent as to prevent his working for a livelihood. Still the money must come from somewhere, so Reggie devised a scheme. His nearest kin and benefactor was an uncle, the Rev. Eben Haddock, who had often, in Reggie's extreme youth, lent a helping hand. The old gentleman was of a benevolent nature and Reggie felt sure of the successful outcome of his plan. Knowing that the old man's most ardent wish was that he, Reggie, should marry and settle down, he writes him that he had at last taken a wife, and of course Reggie's allowance was increased. This, in time, proved inadequate to his mode of living, and a second letter was dispatched that his reverence had been made a grand uncle, and another increase in the allowance was made. For two years everything went well, and Reggie was certainly tearing off the very best this old world affords. Nothing to do but spend Nunky's money. However, there came a jolt one morning, when Reggie receives a letter from his uncle stating he would arrive in New York that day for the sole purpose of seeing the wife and baby. ""Good heavens. I must have a wife, but how."" Well. Timothy Tubbs, the valet, comes to his rescue, and suggests that Mrs. Tubbs play the wife. ""Fine, hut how about the kid?"" ""We'll have her bring along a baby."" The scheme looked good, and Reggie telephones to the valet's wife to come to the apartments at once and bring a baby. Mrs. Tubbs, not unduly bright, thinks he means her own baby, a boy of fourteen. Meanwhile, the Rev. Eben Haddock has arrived and is anxious to see the family, but excuses are made, until at last Mrs. Tubbs dashes in with her boy. She is a sight, still Reggie must make the best of it: but it is out of the question to palm a fourteen-year-old boy off as a two-year-old infant, so Mrs. Tubbs is introduced as Mrs. Reggie Van Twiller and ""Buttons,"" the hallboy, is hustled to the orphan asylum to procure an infant. While uncle is shocked at the sight and manners of the pretended wife, he is annoyingly anxious to see the baby. Excuses are made that it is out with the nurse, and will be hack shortly. At last the word is given that baby is here, for ""Buttons"" has returned. Reggie at last breathes freely, but his case is of short duration, for the asylum nurse enters with the infant, and uncovering its face, one look was enough: ""Great Jupiter, it's a coon!"" Likely enough, for the order simply said ""a two-year-old infant,"" with no mention of race or color. Reggie feels that his meal ticket is irretrievably punched, so you may imagine his surprise when he sees that his uncle is not only amused at what he considers a great joke on Reggie, but greatly relieved to know that the awful freak was only a make-believe wife.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.5,16,tt0000778,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His wife enters, tries to cheer him up, makes a proposition to which he emphatically shakes his head, then, reconsidering, takes a small picture from the wall and gives it to her. She kisses the artist good-bye, takes the picture to the office of Jacob Harris, an art dealer and money lender. Harris inspects the picture, his face lights up for a moment, then assumes a look of indifference. He shakes his head and hands the picture back. The poor woman, on the verge of tears, pleads with him and at last disposes of the picture for a five-pound note. After the woman has gone, Harris smiles to himself over the rare bargain, while the wife returns home and gives the money to her husband. Perkins is in a rage at the paltry price paid, denounces Harris in no uncertain terms and vows to get even if the opportunity is ever offered. A short time after Harris visits a rival art dealer, Moses Goldstein, where the two men are observed discussing business over their wine and cigars. Goldstein gets up and with a look of pride points to a full length portrait of himself which has just been finished. Harris admires it and determines to outdo his rival. Returning to his office he sends a note to Perkins asking him to paint a portrait of himself in character and naming the price of ten pounds. Perkins receives the letter and sees in it the chance he has longed for. He immediately accepts the offer on condition that payment for the same be made in advance. He sets about perfecting his arrangements and a little later Harris enters, and after a short talk pays over the money. The artist hands his victim the outfit of a Samoan warrior, sandals, breast-plate, helmet, sword, etc., and bids him attire himself in an adjoining room. Harris is soon ready, is perched upon a platform in an awkward pose, while the artist apparently works rapidly, so fast in fact that he opens a window to cool himself. Harris, in his scanty clothes, is almost frozen and begs the artist to close the window. He also notices at this time that his clothes are missing and begs the artist to return them. He finally offers ten pounds, but Perkins demands double, which amount is finally given to him. Harris rushes behind the screen, puts on his street clothes, comes out quickly and is shown the artist's conception of himself, a life-sized picture of a jackass.

Little does she realize that his attentions are induced by selfishness, for he knows that her father is well provided with earthly possessions, which he hopes to share. Rejecting Renaldo, she marries Gonzales. At the ceremony Renaldo, though an unbidden guest, approaches and, acquainted with the true nature of the musician, warns him to be faithful to his bride or beware. Gonzales treats this with extreme sangfroid, and when the guests have departed insists upon opening the marriage-box, expecting a goodly sum of money, but his rage is unconfined when he finds it yields but a sheet of paper, on which is written: ""Her husband's love is the bride's best dowry."" Throwing his wife from him, he departs for the wine shop, where he plunges into a whirl of dissipation with his ribald associates. To this place the poor wife comes to beg him to return home, but she is thrown out. Lack of funds sends him home to demand his wife's rings and bracelet, on which to raise money for drink. This she refuses, but is beaten and choked into insensibility and the valuables taken. Back he goes to his despicable companions.

Before leaving the baby the poor mother takes one of its little shoes to keep as a memento. Returning to her cheerless home she is seized with a paroxysm and falls lifeless in a chair, with her little boy at her side. A neighbor hearing her cries runs for the parish priest, who finds the poor woman beyond human aid. Her soul has departed into eternity. She still clutches the little shoe which mutely tells the woman's sad story. The good priest takes the boy as well as his sister's shoe. Meanwhile the baby has been found by the banker and his wife and they decide to adopt it. Fifteen years elapse and we find the girl grown up in blissful ignorance of her origin, of course imagining the banker and his wife her parents, while the boy has gone through his collegiate course preparatory to Holy Orders. One afternoon while walking in the park the boy's attention is attracted by a runaway, and leaping to the roadway he seizes the bridle of a wild fractious horse and brings it to a standstill. Assisting the young lady occupant of the vehicle to a taxicab he escorts her to her home. A strong friendship between the two young people ripens later to love and the boy is seen struggling between the all-important questions as to his future, whether it be religious or secular. His love for the girl is so strong, so pure, that he determines to gain the old priest's consent to his marrying instead of entering the priesthood. What a blow it is to the good old father, but he feels it may be for the best and consents even to marry them. Now the banker's wife thinks it only just to the young people to reveal the truth about the girl, telling how she found her fifteen years before, and that one of her little shoes was missing. At this intelligence the old priest is staggered, for he sees at once that the marriage cannot take place; they are brother and sister. He raises his head in thanksgiving for the grace of God that brought about this timely revelation. However, brother and sister find ""The peace that passeth all understanding."" She becomes a nun and he goes to his ordination into the priesthood, giving their future lives up to the honor and glory of the Divine Master whose guiding hand showed the better way.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.2,74,tt0000801,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walthall","Parker is wooed by young Oliver Sylvester, who is loved by her in return. Her all-absorbing dream is of the day when she will become the happy bride of Oliver. Fortune, however, is unkind to her family and dire straits force her to harken to the proposal of Old Squire Calvin Cartwright, an honest tender-natured farmer of considerable means. Marriage with the Squire would assure Elizabeth of her widowed mother's comfort, hence she consents and is married. Oliver does not seem to realize the truth of the conditions and persistently seeks the poor girl, with a view of alluring her from her aged husband. What a terrible position for the girl, who really loves the fellow and so has not the power to repulse him firmly, her romantic dreams rising, almost taunting, in her mind. While Oliver is pleading earnestly, the Squire enters and fully appreciating her plight, makes the sacrifice, bidding her go with her heart's desire, as he feels he is too old to make her happy and forget. Elizabeth is astounded, and under the influence of her young lover, whom she deludedly believes the soul of honor, accepts the proposed surrender, and leaves with Oliver. They have not gone far when he seizes the weak, trembling girl in his arms and passionately kisses her. That kiss is the awakening. She is aroused from her lethargy and is now fully alive to her sense of duty. Casting her lover aside, she dashes madly to her mother's home, not daring to re-enter that of her husband. The Squire, however, although he seemed impassive at the time, sank into despondency when she was gone, and would have died from grief, had not Elizabeth been persuaded to return to him she had now learned to love.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.0,62,tt0000807,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffith,"Marion Leonard, Charles Inslee, Barry O'Moore","At the Italian boarding house the male boarders were all smitten with the charms of Minnie, the landlady's pretty daughter, but she was of a poetic turn of mind and her soul soared above plebeianism and her aspirations were romantic. Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive. The arrival at the boarding house from the old country of Giuseppe Cassella, the violinist, filled the void in her yearning heart. Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie. All this, of course, filled Grigo with bitter hatred and he vows vengeance, which you may be sure he will work with extreme subtlety. All preparations are made for the wedding, and when the day arrives Grigo is ready for it. He has contrived an infernal machine with a pistol so arranged that its explosion means death to anyone standing in front of it. The little church is decorated in honor of the affair and Grigo, with subterfuge, gets the sexton out, leaving the place to himself. Sawing a hole in front of the altar step, he places his weapon in such a position that one step forward by the priest would mean death to the bride kneeling in front. Grigo rushes hack to his room, arriving just as the wedding party is leaving for the church. Here he becomes a victim of the frenzy of his mind, and appreciating the fact that the awful deed will he laid to him and his apprehension will be inevitable, he writes a gloating note and then takes poison. His fall is heard by the housemaid, who, discovering the note, gives it to a policeman, who rushes madly to the church. Fate, however, seems to conspire, and the officer falls, breaking his ankle, just outside the church. A newsboy, seeing his plight, runs up, and the policeman directs him hurriedly to the church, where he arrives just in time to save the couple, who start back at his yell, for the priest had just made the step which fires the gun, but with no harm done. The priest gives thanks to God for their deliverance and proceeds with the wedding.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMxMzQwNjEtYjQ0Yy00Mjk1LWE2MWItNjYwY2NhY2I3OWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.4,177,tt0000797,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now he walks the streets in rags, being so reduced to poverty. But no one has any sympathy for him, because he is young, and a strong-looking man, and ought to be able to get his living by working. Fielding comes across a newsboy, and cannot help but admire the little chap, who is busy selling papers and taking in the pennies, and notes how he understands to sell to everyone who comes along. He envies the boy being able to take in money in such an apparently easy way. When the boy is through tor the day, Fielding follows him up. The boy makes his way to an old shed outside the town, where Fielding sees him lie down to rest. For a moment Fielding is tempted to rob the boy of his earnings, but his good nature gets the upper hand, and he walks away in despair. Rather would he end his own life than do any harm to the innocent boy. The boy, having noticed him, gets up, runs after him, and asks him if he is hungry. Fielding has to admit it, of course, and accepts from the boy a few pennies to buy food. But the temptation is too great, and he spends this money for drink. The boy, who has been watching him all the time, enters the public house, and takes away the glass from Fielding, saying: ""Now let's go and have something to eat; I didn't give you money for drink."" The strong will of the boy seems to influence Fielding, and he realizes suddenly that he must do some work, in order to make a living. He succeeds in finding a situation as porter and he and the boy from now on become very great friends. Fielding works very hard, and they can soon afford to take very nice rooms together and also to go on nice outings on Saturday afternoons. One day Fielding is sweeping in front of his employer's house, when be bears a cry, and looking up he is astonished to see the child of his employer just falling from one of the windows of the house. Fortunately he catches her in his arms, and although the child is unhurt by the fall, the weight coming down on him from such a height causes some slight injuries to Fielding's head and arm. He has to be carried home, and his grateful employer accompanies him to his room, where he hears the whole story of Fielding's and his boy friend's struggles. In appreciation to Fielding for saving his little child from an almost certain death, his employer provides him with ample money to nurse himself quickly back to health, and also obtains such a good position from his employer that he is able to marry a nice girl, and the newsboy lives with them, in a very comfortable home, often receiving thanks from Fielding for saving him from ruin.",None,Denmark,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM3MGVhNGMtYTRhMC00NjJiLThiNjItNWM5NDJmNDZkYWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,N/A,11,tt0000803,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Broncho Billy' Anderson,"Daniel Roberts is the father of two youngsters of about the same age, yet vastly different in their moral make-up. Frank is the model ""good child"" of the village, loved by his father and mother for his good behavior, while John is just the opposite, being unruly to his elders, always into mischief, and bringing mortification to his despairing parents. Ten years elapse, and we find John sowing his wild oats, while Frank obtains employment in a broker's office. While he stays late at the office nights, John entertains chorus girls at midnight suppers. John's conduct finally exasperates his father, and one night when he comes home intoxicated he is ordered from the house and told never to return until he has proven himself a man. During the twenty years that follow, Frank accumulates a vast fortune, but his extreme selfishness and miserliness causes him to neglect his parents, who are now growing old. Unable to pay the mortgage on their little home, the father and mother call at their son's Wall Street office with the hope of securing aid from him. They find the broker very busy, at first declining to give them audience and finally insulting the old gentleman by sarcastically handing him a small coin when the father tells him of their need. Cursing his son for his base ingratitude, the father takes the mother away. Nothing is left for them but the poorhouse. They are taken there and given shelter, while their son, who had been such a model youth, lives in luxury, laughing at the scoring the newspapers give him for the ill treatment of his aged parents. But away out West, John Roberts, now a millionaire mine owner, reads the news of his parents' plight; his big heart melts and he makes all haste to return East. Going to the poorhouse, he makes himself known to his father and mother and takes them away, promising them a home with him. When he hears the story of his brother's conduct he resolves to punish him. Knowing the man's greed for money and power, at an opportune moment he steps into the wheat pit and arrays himself against the erstwhile Wheat King. This scene, ""Brother Against Brother."" is one of intense interest and excitement. Surrounded by money-mad brokers and speculators, the two brothers fight it out, John staking his rich mine against the vast wealth of his brother. At the stroke of the closing gong, Frank Roberts is no longer the King of Wall Street, but a. penniless beggar. The happy reunion of father, mother and their long-lost son makes a pretty sequel to this most interesting picture.",None,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000810,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His loyal friends in France, however, would not rest, and were untiring in their efforts to liberate the Emperor from his prison. The first part of this film depicts a meeting of a few of these friends and supporters, who formulate a plan. A letter is written to Napoleon, explaining that a messenger will bring him all particulars and plans of a plot to liberate him. A young officer is elected to make the dangerous journey to Elba, to carry to Napoleon the message from his friends. But these friends did not count on the enemies which every great man has, and did not observe that one of them attended their eventful meeting. The traitor informs the police, whose assistance he obtains, and together they go in pursuit of the messenger. Tired and exhausted, the messenger finds rest for a night at a small inn on the road, but not long after his arrival there his two pursuers arrive also, and over a glass of wine discuss how they can best capture the messenger. The daughter of the innkeeper, a great admirer of Napoleon, overhears the discussion of the two men, and immediately warns the messenger, who has just sufficient time to ride away, hotly pursued by the enemies. Fortunately, he soon reaches a farm house on his way, and induces the farmer to give him other clothes. Hastily changing his dress, and with the assistance of the farmer, who shows the pursuers the wrong way, he manages to get to the frontier. He arrives safely at the coast, from which he is to take the boat to Elba. Before he lands on the coast of the island, his small craft is demolished by the waves, and he is compelled to swim through the foaming sea to his destination. But even here, on this lonely island, he is discovered by a sentry, who uses his rifle effectively, and with a bullet-wound in his shoulder the poor messenger turns back into the water, pretending to be killed. Swimming to a more secluded spot along the coast, he sees the figure of his beloved Emperor standing by the water, looking sadly in the direction of his country. Trembling with excitement, the brave messenger approaches Napoleon and delivers to him the message. Napoleon, deeply moved by the loyalty of his friends, thanks the messenger in kind words, and embraces him, to show his deep and sincere gratitude.",None,Denmark,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFlYzc0ZWMtMWY0Yi00MmM3LWFmMWUtNjcxZmY1YzMxNjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,3.9,21,tt0000817,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Griffith,"Frank Powell, Mary Pickford, Kate Bruce","George Peabody is a young man who has been giving free rein to his inclinations, the principal one being drink. One might have concluded he was lost, but there was the chance which the hand of Providence always bestows in the person of pretty little Ruth King, who had secretly loved George since their childhood days. She succeeds in persuading him from his reckless life, and he determines to cut off from his old loose companions by going out West and making a man of himself. Bidding Ruth and her mother good-bye, he realizes that he loves his little preserver and promises to return worthy of her love and confidence. They plight their troth with their first kiss and a heart shaped locket, which Ruth wears, she breaking it in two, giving George one side while she retains the other, which symbolized the reunion of their hearts with his return. George is fortunate to strike the West in the midst of a boom, and being an affable, bright chap, meets with success, and is soon a favorite with his employers. His life here up to this is without a blemish, but has he strength? We shall see, for as gold is tested by the fire, so a man is by temptation, and George's trial comes with the persuasion to take a drink. At first he holds out against it, but at last yields, and that drink was his undoing. Once more the craving for liquor is induced and his promise to his little sweetheart in the East is forgotten, he falls an easy victim of a Mexican girl, who pretends to love him, assuming him a rather good catch. Meanwhile, faithful little Ruth is counting the days as they drag on towards the time she imagines he will return. The Mexican girl, to secure him as her own, writes a letter to Ruth purporting to come from one of his male chums to the effect that he had been killed. The shock of this letter throws the poor girl into a delirium of fever, and for a time her life is despaired of. She recovers, however, but is hopelessly blind. What woe a man's weakness may work, but we find he is rewarded for his weakness, and some time later we see George a loathsome parasite, a dirty, ragged, drunken bum a pariah among his former associates. Back East he wanders, ignorant of the misery he has caused, and what a sight greets him. There is the ever faithful little girl, accompanied by her mother, standing at the gate, the beauties of the world forever shut out from her. How dark is everything to her, but then how much darker would this world have been, had she viewed the awful condition of George as he stood there. No, of this, at least, she is blissfully ignorant, and with a subterfuge. George slinks away; she imagining that he will soon return, but, alas, the locket is forever broken.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ0NjQzOWYtYzA5MC00ZDNkLTkwYmYtYmFiMDc0YjRlODZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.6,130,tt0000816,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Burglar's Mistake,1909,N/A,25 Mar 1909,10 min,Short,D.W. Griffith,D.W. Griffith,"Harry Solter, Charles Inslee, Marion Leonard","A thrilling story of an attempt at blackmail. How many of us are wont to look back and wish that we might blot out from our memory the ever recurring specter of the follies of our youth. Such was the experience of Henry J. Newman, a wealthy banker, who, in the flippant Spring of his life was guilty of a slight indiscretion which now in the sober Autumn of his existence seems so iniquitous that he fain would forget it, and above all keep it from knowledge of his family, not that it was enormous, for it was not, as Newman was a man whose standard of morals was high. However, this one false step was known of by Dick Folson, an unconscionable wretch, who, knowing Newman's sensitive nature, sees in the episode an elegant chance for graft, or rather blackmail, which he proceeds to take advantage of. He writes a letter to Newman telling him he has convincing proof of the affair and asking if it is worth to him $300 a month to keep mum. If not Mrs. Newman will be apprised of all. The letter arrives at a most opportune time to lend success to Folson's design, for Newman is surrounded by his little family, enjoying to the extreme mellifluous domesticity. He goes to his office and sends an answer to Folson saying that his demand is unreasonable and begging him to have pity. Folson writes an answer, but on second thought goes to Newman's office himself and to Newman's entreaties simply replies that it is either $300 a month, the first payment at once, or he will expose him to his wife. Newman at length yields and Folson goes away satisfied for the month at least. The money does not last long under the strain of Folson's dissipations and a week later finds him broke again. In this condition he is visited by one of his companions, who is setting out on a burglaring expedition and wants his assistance. In his present frame of mind he is ready for anything, and so readily consents, not even bothering to inquire where the job is to he pulled off. Arriving at the house they effect an entrance, and get to work gathering in the articles of value. It is not long before they are surprised by someone coming, and start to beat a hasty retreat. One of them gets out, but Folson stumbles and falls and the man of the house is on him, with revolver in hand. Folson scrambles to his feet and finds himself face to face with Newman. For a moment he feels easy, as he assumes he is safe, hut the awful reality dawns on him when Newman tells him he can now without compunction put him out of the way forever, for is he not a burglar? And is it not perfectly reasonable for him to shoot him as such? Well yon may he sure that Newman does not let slip this opportunity of assuring himself and his family peace of mind from now on, so when the police carry off the inanimate form of the intruder.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.5,67,tt0000819,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Porter,Mary Fuller,"The opening scene shows an Indian squaw carrying her sick papoose down the trail to the bank of a stream where she bathes its feverish brow with the cooling water. Despairing of its life, she determines to seek the white man's medicine in the nearby village. Pushing her way into the little mission chapel as the mass is being recited, she lays her papoose at the feet of the priest who, mistaking her gestures, baptizes it. Satisfied that the child has received the white man's medicine, she departs and her gratitude knows no bounds when the child recovers. An emigrant train, crossing the plains a dozen or more years later, camps not far from the shores of the stream from which the daughter of one of the party is seen filling a pail with water, unconscious of the stealthy approach of a canoe containing Indian braves. She is overpowered, tied hand and foot and brought to the Indian village, where a council of war decides that her fate shall be death at the stake on the morrow. And here is repaid the debt of gratitude that an Indian is said never to forget. The squaw, whose papoose was spared to her through the good offices of the white man, as she thought, and who has grown to be a fine lad, takes a handkerchief from the captive, and placing it in the lad's moccasin, bids him carry it to the captive's friends. Stealing from the village, Uray, the ""Child of the Forest,"" sets off at top speed in the direction indicated to him. By the aid of the camera we see him climbing precipitous cliffs and picking his wearying footsteps through treacherous swamps. His leg injured by a fall, he presses on, imbued with but one thought, his duty. Coming to the edge of a lake, Uray hesitates only long enough to get his bearings, then plunges in and swims across with long, graceful strokes. Reaching the opposite shore, he falls exhausted, rises and falls again, and again drags himself to his feet and continues his weary journey, finally reaching the emigrants' camp, where, after delivering his message, he swoons. The campers and cowboys mount in haste, and by hard riding reach the Indian village before the captive is put to the stake. After a sharp fight the Indians are routed and the captive, together with the friendly squaw, brought back to camp.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000824,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She secretly approves the clean-cut young Englishman, but Betty is a sad little flirt and she thinks it never would do to let him perceive the impression he has made. To hide her real feelings she is inclined to hector him a bit and delights in putting his love to the test. They are walking by the lake when Betty decides that she desires some water lilies, well knowing that there are none within reach of the shore and that no boat is at hand. Basil, nothing daunted, strides into the water and gathers a double handful. All would have been well, but, in returning to shore, Basil has the misfortune to step upon a sunken log, which turns under his tread and causes him to lose his balance. He is a sorry sight when he reaches the shore and triumphantly presents his lilies to Betty. As they turn toward the house, Cecil Gilman, a visitor to the Kenyons, is presented to her, and she accepts his escort, a little bit ashamed of the bedraggled appearance of Howard and more than willing to tease him by mildly flirting with the newcomer. Men from the city are particularly attractive to those who live apart from the whirl of town life, and Gilman makes rapid progress in his flirtation with Betty, who delights in tormenting the man she really loves. At the County Ball she ignores the evidence of her programme to dance Basil's single dance with the Londoner, and a quarrel is the result, Basil vowing that he never will speak to so fickle a woman again. There has been an epidemic of burglaries in the vicinity of the Kenyon estate, and when Squire Kenyon is called to London on business he is glad that he leaves for the protection of his household so brave a man as Gilman declared himself to be. That night Basil, strolling through the grounds and taking a mournful delight in looking at the light in Betty's window, surprises the housebreakers entering the Kenyon home. He follows them and arrives upon the scene just as Betty and her mother have been thrown aside by the thieves, who are throttling Gilman. Basil's opportune arrival turns the tables for a moment, but one of the intruders uses his gun. Basil is wounded and things begin to look dark again, but the shots have alarmed the police who come to the rescue of the household. The last scene shows Basil able to be about again, and Betty shyly confesses that he is her choice and that she flirted with Gilman merely to rouse his jealousy, the scene closing on a pretty tableau of the betrothal.",None,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000808,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drinking and auto speeding forms the principal occupation of those who have nothing but money and time at their disposition. On one of their auto rides Norris meets a pretty simple country girl, who is artlessness personified. She sits on the porch of her humble home endeavoring to arrange her raven tresses as she sees pictured before her in the fashion paper. The old father sits by admiring her who is all in all to him. Norris alights and asks for a drink of water, and the girl's simplicity induces his dangerous attentions. A second visit is made, and he prevails upon the girl to meet him clandestinely. To this she accedes, and with the aid of his companions, the young man plans a deception, one of his associates volunteering to play the part of the minister. The pretended marriage performed, the young man takes the girl to the Summer hotel at which he is stopping. Meanwhile, the old father becomes uneasy at his child's absence, and approaching the café the young man frequents, he learns the truth from the boasting, reckless youths, who do not enlighten him as to his daughter's whereabouts. Returning home almost broken hearted, he swears to kill on sight the young profligate who lured his child off. The chums of the young man arrive at the hotel and intimate to the girl the nature of the situation, and she demands the truth from Norris, learning which she flies out of the place to make her way homeward on foot.

Confidence is the flower grown from the seed of true friendship, watered by the tears of adversity, and often assailed by the blight of calumny. For as Shakespeare says', ""be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny."" So it was with little Nellie Burton, the orphan girl of the rancho, who budding into womanhood, realizes her position and appreciates the low brutal character of the habitués of the Dive, even discerning the true nature of her fancied sweetheart, Jim Colt, who was to say the least an unconscionable villain. Tiring of her present environments she decides to leave the place seek a nobler and higher life. To this end she makes her way eastward and applies for a position as nurse at a New York hospital, and we next find her engaged in that work of mercy ""ministering to the sick."" Her mild manners and pure nature impress the head surgeon, a man of eminence in his profession, to such an extent that he finds himself deeply in love with this poor self-sacrificing girl. He proposes marriage, which she at first mildly declines, but he at length persuades her, and they are married. However, there must come a cloud, and this is in the shape of her girlhood sweetheart, Colt, who has migrated East, and living on his wits. He runs across Nellie in the company with her husband as she enters her own home. The low conniving nature at once asserts itself and he plans a scheme of blackmail, using as capital her pure innocent love letters. Waiting a favorable opportunity, Jim Colt ""visits'' her and with a threat of showing these letters to her husband he extorts money from her. This gone he comes for more, and as she has no ready cash he takes her jewels. The money raised on these goes the same way, so he calls to make another demand. This the poor helpless girl finds unable to meet, and during their argument the surgeon enters. Colt then hands the missives over to the husband who, taking the packet throws them into the tire and has Colt forcibly ejected from the place, with the positive injunction never to return.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBjM2MxYmYtMjgwOS00NzI4LWJmOTUtZWNkZDczNmQzM2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcwNjUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.3,114,tt0000828,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His demands are met with a positive rebuff, and when he becomes insistent be is forcibly ejected by Galora. As he leaves the tenement he vows to get even, and lies in wait until Galora has gone out on business. Climbing to the fifth floor, on which the Galoras live, he watches his chance, which comes when Mrs. Galora goes for an instant to visit a neighbor on the same floor.

Griffith,"Harry Solter, George Gebhardt, Florence Lawrence","It was at the City of Cawnpore on a feast day that the faithful assembled in the temple to worship at the shrine of Brahma, the first person of the Hindu triune God, comprising Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, sometimes called the Brahmin Trinity. In this Hindu pantheon there gathered natives of the Ganges Valley of all castes, with the priests, their wives, and houris; also a generous sprinkling of Western tourists, they being drawn thither by their thirst for sight-seeing. Most kaleidoscopic was the scene as out of its midst towered the stately idol Brahma. In the forehead of the idol there was embedded a mammoth diamond of fabulous value. This was termed the ""Light of the World."" Among the tourists there is one who, a stranger in a strange land, finds himself in a depleted condition as regards finances. Extravagant and improvident, he is piling up a bill at the Cawnpore Hotel without funds to meet it. The sight of this diamond at once arouses his cupidity and he determines to secure it at any hazard. A visit to the temple shows that the Brahma is attended by one veiled guard. He also learns that this guard has a sweetheart who visits him during his lonely vigil. Enlisting the services of an unscrupulous Hindu they follow the girl to her home where they force her and her father to go with them to the temple, where under threat of her father's murder she gives drugged wine to her lover, the guard. He immediately falls into a stupor, and binding the father and girl, the tourist seizes the diamond and makes his way back to the hotel. Recovering his senses, the guard gives alarm, and he and the girl are taken to prison where he is doomed to die at the end of three days for the desecration of Brahma. The girl, however, offers to remain hostage if her lover be allowed to search for the diamond. This noble offer is accepted and the girl is chained to the floor of the dungeon, while the guard, humiliated by the confiscation of his royal turban, according to the law, is set free to bring back if he can the diamond. Should he not succeed in the allotted time, three days, the girl will pay the penalty with her life. He first rushes to the Yogi, the royal seer, who shows him on the mystic mirror the face of the robber. The guard at once recognizes him as the tourist who had visited the temple, and sets out to find him, which he does at the hotel, just after the tourist has sewed the diamond up in the handle of his suit case. He contrives to engage himself as a servant and as such makes a fruitless search of the tourist's effects, He is on the point of despairing when the tourist is called upon by a diamond merchant. Effecting his presence in the room by hypnotic power, the guard manages to secure the diamond and dashing madly back to the dungeon arrives just in time to stay the uplifted scimitar from the neck of the faithful girl.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ5NTllNmItZGU1ZC00ZDMwLThlNmQtMjA1MDgwNWIxZDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.0,66,tt0000815,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With crushed spirit, bitter against the world he makes his way through the streets, apparently shunned by all; in fact a social leper. However, there is one man who befriends him, and uses his influence to have him employed as a laborer on street construction work. He now begins to feel that life is worthwhile, but the very next day fate's treachery demonstrates itself and hopes are blighted. It occurs in this way: he is forced, through no fault of his own, into a bitter quarrel with one of the workmen, and in self-protection lands a fatal blow with his fist, and he is again seen in the terrible grind of prison life. Clad in stripes he toils at breaking stone, cuffed and dogged by despotic guards until his pent-up fury at last bursts forth and he makes a dash for liberty. Crawling and creeping like a serpent, and hunted like a rat, be finally comes upon a scarecrow in the field and dons the tattered garments in lieu of his stripes. Thus garbed his flight is more promising, when he espies a notice of the reward of $100 for his capture. Tearing the odious announcement from the post, which action was observed by a country boy, he wanders on, only to find he is still pursued by the armed guards, who had been informed by the yokel. Rushing madly on he finally comes upon a dilapidated cottage, which he deems a rather safe haven. Entering, he is astounded to find that by a strange designing of fate it is the home of the one man who had been his friend when he was released from prison. Desperate poverty together with the illness of one of his children, has shrouded the poor home with sorrow. As the fugitive stands and views the woe-stricken family his flinty heart softens. He remembers that the man was a friend indeed, when he himself was most in need. Here was his chance to reciprocate, and calling the guards who are lurking around outside forces the man to accept the reward for his capture. As he leaves the house the self-sacrificing convict falls a fatal victim to one of the vengeful guard's guns.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.7,59,tt0000829,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All nature smiles as we make our way up the lane, lined on each side with blossoming trees and fragrant flowers, until we come upon Doctor Harcourt, one of God's noblemen, seated on the veranda of his house with his wife and little daughter Edith. All are carefree and happy as we stroll with them through the barley fields, lanes and daisy beds. It is indeed a beautiful sight, a trinity of souls, each living in the other's being. But the fates are jealous, and there are gathering clouds to shut out the radiance of their happy existence. Little Edith is taken very ill and the doctor is at first inclined to think his wife is unduly alarmed, but upon examining the child he realizes the illness to be serious indeed, so much so that it would probably be fatal for him to leave its side until the crisis is past. While so engaged a poor woman of the village hurries to his home to enlist his services for her little girl, who she fears is at the point of death. Oh, God! what a situation. His own child needing his undivided attention most urgently, on the one hand, and duty on the other. Duty, that relentless deity of the honorable which so often compels self-sacrifice, beckons him on. Irresolute for a moment, he at length goes, assuring his wife that be will be but a few minutes away. Arriving at the humble cabin of the woman, he finds her child very ill indeed, requiring speedy and unerring attention to save her. Meanwhile, Edith, his own child, has grown worse, and the mother has dispatched the maid to hurry him back home. When the maid arrives and tells him the conditions, he for a moment wavers, but then his duty seems clear to him. If he leaves the poor woman's child, death is inevitable, so he dismisses the maid with the word that it will be only a few minutes longer and then he will return. Little Edith sinks rapidly, so the maid is again sent. This time he is about to leave, as the child is out of danger and will recover. So he leaves the poor family, happy and relieved, to rush madly to his own home. What a contrast! There across the lifeless form of his dear child lies his moaning, horror-stricken wife. A slave of duty, he yields the life of his own dear child to save the life of another's. The valley of Stillwater is shrouded in darkness.

It has been an arduous struggle for fame with poor Harry and when poverty's wolf is howling at their threshold he resolves to go out and seek employment which may not be as congenial as art, but will prove decidedly more remunerative. But his wife will not allow it. She pleads with him to hope on, work at his painting while she goes to seek a position as teacher of piano at the Conservatory, His ambitious spirit is compelling and he allows her to go. Piano lessons, indeed. The brave girl gets a job in the laundry at the washtubs. However, she has grit and with her first day's pay, one dollar, she drags her sore body homeward, stopping on the way to buy a few provisions. Dauntless, she goes the next day to give ""piano lessons"" at the washboard, and while away an art collector calls on Colton and purchases his masterpiece tor a goodly sum, with a promise or more purchases to come. His joy is boundless and he cannot wait until evening to tell Mabel the good news, so he rushes to the Conservatory, and, of course, does not find her. She has never been there: they don't know her. He stands for a moment paralyzed. ""My God! She has been deceiving me. I shall cast her off forever."" And rushing home he is writing a farewell note, when the door opens and poor Mabel is carried in a sorry sight to behold. She had fallen into one of the tubs of boiling suds and her arms are scalded from hands to shoulders. Harry, when he realizes the awful sacrifice of the girl, and all for him, is about to gather her in his arms, but she cries with pain, and he can only kiss the tip of her finger.

An old Spanish Hidalgo becomes deeply involved in financial reverses and Manuella, a wealthy ranchero, helps him out. However, things have gone from bad to worse, and the old man finds himself at the mercy of Manuella, who, while not of the Draconian nature, of course expects his money or the security. He calls to apprise the old man that his notes are overdue, and insists upon a settlement, which the poor old fellow is unable to do. While there he meets Mercedes, the old man's beautiful daughter, and falls deeply in love with her, and offers to cancel the obligations for the daughter's hand in marriage. Now Mercedes is enamored of Carlos, a poor peon of the village, whom she loves in return and when the suggestion of the ranchero is broached she indignantly repulses it. However, upon realizing her poor father's condition she decides to make the sacrifice and consents. She then bids Carlos call to see her to break the unpleasant intelligence to him and part company. The lover calls and is almost heartbroken when Mercedes tells him the sad news. While they are engaged in the act of separating, the ranchero enters the adjoining room and through the half open door hears the sorrowful word of the last farewell between the young couple. He is so touched by the pure, self-sacrificing love of the lovers, that he softens and feels he is worthy of bitter reproach for being the instrument of tearing asunder two trusting hearts such as these, so he makes up his mind that such shall not be. He then enters the room, and bidding the young ones to be of good heart, he not only joins their hands in bonds of true love, but makes them a present of the promissory notes which he had threateningly held over her father's head but a few moments before. This is one case of where eavesdropping was attended by ecstatic results.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.6,41,tt0000853,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That Harry and Margie deeply loved each other is most apparent; that Dad had a strong aversion for Harry as a son-in-law is also apparent, and when he finds them in clandestine conference there is something doing. Harry is chased about the room by Dad with a cane, which in a wild sweep at Harry goes through a pier mirror. Oh, the woe of it. This might be considered ominous, and it was for Dad, but it was the omen of good fortune for the lovers. As an extreme measure Dad decides to send Margie to Europe with his sister, her aunty, to be out of reach of Harry. Bright scheme, you would say. Well Aunty's vanity was the undoing. She insists on a new and elaborate gown, so Dad gives her the money to buy it. Harry learns of this and follows Aunty to the store and buys an exact duplicate of her traveling outfit. Attired in it he visits Margie's home. Upon entering he is almost confronted by Aunty similarly attired. To hide he dodges behind the mirror, and oh horror, the broken glass has been removed. Here is a predicament. Aunty is approaching. Ah! an idea. Harry stands his ground and when Aunty comes to the mirror, she also not knowing it has been removed, he mimics her antics to a nicety, so she imagines him a reflex, and so exits perfectly satisfied with herself. Dad then appears and shoving a roll of bills into masquerading Harry's hand, sends him off with Margie for Europe (?), but instead they go to the minister's.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.7,51,tt0000855,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walthall","Free adaptation of George Eliot's ""Silas Marner."" This Biograph adaptation makes Master Marner a cobbler instead of a linen weaver, but this change does not weaken, nor make less romantic, the story. Silas is first seen in the act of ministering to his dying friend, and while engaged in this act of mercy. William Dane enters stealthily and steals the dying man's money, leaving Marner's handkerchief alongside the dresser so as to throw the blame on him. The money is discovered missing, and. of course, circumstantial evidence points conclusively to Marner, who protests innocence, and is given a chance of vindicating himself through that old superstitious practice of visiting the church and in presence of the elders in the vestry kneels and prays and draws lots. Fate is against him, and he draws the black card which declares him guilty. This is final, and his friends shun him as they would a leper. He makes good the stolen money out of his own hard-earned savings, and leaves his native village for another section of the country. Here he pursues his vocation of shoemaking. His trouble has made him a misanthrope and miser, niggardly hoarding the gains of his toil, guarding it with a jealousy induced by despicable money lust. A confirmed recluse, he spurns the advances of all: beggars are driven away empty-handed, with vituperation; in fact, the strain of charity hitherto dominant in his nature is effaced. His one thought is his golden coins; his only pleasure is the musical clink as they fall from his hands in counting them, afterwards biding them in the wall by removing a stone and placing them behind it. One day this is observed by a couple of thieves who peer through his window. Awaiting an opportunity, they enter during his absence and seize the money, making off with it. When Silas re-enters he sets about indulging in his only diversion, but what a revelation! The money is gone. Like a maniac he dashes out in search of the thieves, but without success, returning and dropping on his workbench in utter despair. Meanwhile, a poor, deserted mother of the parish, with her little child, wanders from her home in quest of her perfidious husband, only to die on the road. The child, alone, continues on the way, and entering Marner's hovel, sinks exhausted on the hearthstone. Silas arouses from his lethargy and is amazed to find the little baby, which toddles to his arms. What a change comes over him! Folding the little one to his breast, he exclaims, ""This shall be my recompense."" Indeed a fair exchange. That moment his flinty heart softens and he becomes benevolence personified.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.3,60,tt0000861,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walker does not appreciate the strength of her avowal, and leaves, promising to return to her her letters in his possession. But Walker little knows the fury of a woman scorned, and she at once sets to work to wreak a vengeance that is as cunning as it is terrible.

Here he is, ten miles away, and the messenger, who has much the start of him speeding by railway towards the goal. Hurling the woman aside, with an invective of denunciation, he rushes to his automobile and commands the chauffeur to drive on, disregarding all speed laws, for it is life and death in the balance. On they go like mad through lanes, around curves, over hills, slowing up for nothing. At one point in the journey a toll gate is closed, but it proves to be no handicap, for they come on relentlessly plowing through the obstacle, smashing it into pieces. At another point a farmer's wagon is seen trolling slowly across the road, and the auto coming on at a furious speed, hits and demolishes it, and passes leaving the poor farmer ruefully gazing upon the wreck. On, on goes the auto until Mignon's house is reached. But the messenger boy has arrived, delivered his charge and departed.

The Biograph here holds up to your pity a court-fool, whose inordinate love for his child prompted him to plan vengeance which reverted upon himself. The Duke suffers from melancholia and his courtiers are at wits' end to dissipate his ennui. Diversion of all sorts are brought, but without success, until at last they decide to abduct the pretty daughter of the fool and bring her to the Duke. This is effected, and when the Duke sees her he falls deeply in love with her, but her pure innocence instills in him a higher, holier devotion than he was accustomed to experience, so he harkens to her plea, and throwing his cloak about her, sees her safely home. This is witnessed by the fool, who is in hiding, and misjudging the Duke's attitude, vows vengeance. To this end he enlists the services of a nomad couple who are dwelling in a hut not far off. He bargains with them that to kill the man he shall point out he will pay them five hundred louis. The pact is made, and the Duke is pointed out to them by the fool as he strolls in the gardens with the girl. As the Duke leaves the girl she espies the trio skulking on the grounds and follows them to the hut, where she overhears the plan. She at once decides to save the Duke, but how? To tell him would incriminate her old father. Nothing seems feasible but self-sacrifice, which she bravely determines to do. Going to her house, she dons male attire and with the cloak the Duke had loaned her thrown over her shoulders she bids adieu to her home and life and like a soldier goes bravely unto death. Entering the hut, her face hidden, she receives the blow intended for another and dies before the horror-stricken gypsy couple, who discover their mistake.

The fool is now in a state of fiendish exultation over the seeming success of his vengeance, and after dancing gleefully around the sack, determines to make away with it, but upon picking it up is startled by the litheness of the form enclosed. Ripping open the sack, the sight that greets him fairly freezes his blood, for there lies his own daughter, cold in death, a victim of his own dastardly plot.

Fools of Fate,1909,N/A,07 Oct 1909,11 min,"Short, Drama",D.W. Griffith,Frank E. Woods,"James Kirkwood, Marion Leonard, Frank Powell","Fanny is the wife of Ben Webster, a trapper, and while he is an affectionate and dutiful husband, she yearns for something which appears better than her lot. She reasons: ""Have I not youth and beauty and attainments far above this environment? Why should I be compelled to toil and struggle in this wilderness?"" Truly, she did not know just what she yearned for, still a change of any sort would have been acceptable. Discontent is stamped upon her countenance, as Ben bids her good bye for a hunting trip in the North Woods. Webster embarks in his canoe, and sighting game, stands to fire. The light craft is overturned, throwing him into the water. Weighted down by his heavy clothing and cartridge belt, he would have drowned had not his plight been witnessed from the shore by Ed Hilton, a Canadian hunter. Hilton leaps in and succeeds in dragging the half-drowned trapper to land, where a strong friendship springs up between the two, and as night falls they make camp and sleep under the same blanket. Next morning they part with a vow of eternal friendship. Fanny goes to the village grocery store, and by chance meets Hilton, and it is a case of love at first sight with both, each, of course, ignorant of the other's identity. A second meeting is contrived and Hilton, thinking her a single girl, suggests an elopement, to which she consents. A meeting place is planned, and Fanny is there and leaves with Hilton his cabin. She has, however, left a note for Ben saying that she ""is tired, and is going away."" Poor Webster's heart nearly breaks as he reads this short, but cutting letter. Grief at first possesses him, then revenge. Taking up his gun, he starts after her. He hits a trail with the aid of a couple of villagers who had witnessed unseen the clandestine meeting of Fanny and the Canadian. Tracking them to the cabin he bursts in a few moments after their arrival. You may imagine the amazement on both sides when Ben finds Hilton is the man, and Hilton learns that Webster's wife is the woman. Hilton proves his innocence by commanding Webster to shoot; but no, Ben cannot kill the man to whom he owes his life, and so he staggers out and hack to his own home. Hilton, on the other hand, drives the heartless Fanny from him. She goes out, and for a time is undecided, when she resolves to face her husband and beg his forgiveness. Night has fallen and the cabin is in darkness when she enters. Going to the next room she gets the lantern, by which light she sees her husband sitting with his head reclining on the table. She assumes it is his grief, but on touching him, his inert form falls to the floor, he has terminated his existence. The shock causes her to recoil, and so doing knocks over the lantern, extinguishing the light. There in the shaft of moonlight we leave her kneeling beside the awful result of her discontent.

His favorite daughter is critically ill, and combined with his duties as the fun-maker at the show, is that of nursing the sick child. His elder daughter is also a member of the troop. With his two children and his devoted wife he lives in a large dressing tent pitched at the edge of the arena. Here is indicated the story of the picture. We see the circus arrive, to the great joy of the villagers. Then we see the little girl carried on her couch out of the wagon. As the film is unreeled we witness a varied and interesting circus performance. The clown, as usual, being the cause of hilarity. There are acrobatic turns by clever performers and some wonderful tricks done by extremely well trained animals. The effect upon the assembled villagers is interesting to note, the clown's work eliciting the greatest applause. We, who are by means of the camera permitted to witness the other side of the clown's life in the interior of his home, see the suffering and parental anxiety of the man. This is the whole theme of the picture. The poor fellow, faithful to his work, goes through his act with well-simulated gaiety and enthusiasm, though his heart is breaking from fear and anxiety over his little girl. In addition to worrying over the illness of one child, a little incident, which occurs in the circus ring, shows that the father has a watchful eye where his pretty elder daughter is concerned. The ending of the picture is a happy one and we see the departure of the circus. The man who has interested us leaves for new fields with a happy smile that is not altogether assumed. The picture should not fail to amuse the children, and the blending of comedy and pathos is sure to carry weight with the older people.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000888,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mrs. Edmonds tries hard to dissemble and keep her sorrow from the little one, but he too misses the society of papa, his little romps with him and his good-night kiss on going to bed, until at last he is constrained to write papa a note complaining of his neglect.

The two young fellows have been pals up to the time they meet Kitty, when a bitter rivalry rises between them. Kitty presents Stephen Bronson, one of her admirers, with her latest photograph, but shows her impartiality when she gives Stephen Howard, the other suitor, a similar photograph. The two young fellows finally resolve to see the girl together and ask her to choose between them. When they state their case to Kitty, she hesitates but a moment and gives her hand to Bronson. Howard manfully withdraws, after shaking hands with Bronson and wishing the two a happy life together. It is not long, however, before Bronson shows the other side of his nature. Bronson loses money gambling and plans to reimburse himself by appropriating another ranchman's cattle. Bronson takes into his confidence one Will Parsons, another cowpuncher, and when night falls they visit the corral and make away with a half-dozen of the ranchman's choicest steers. Parsons is sent on to sell the cattle while Bronson rides off to visit his sweetheart. In the meantime discovery of the theft is made, and a photograph of Kitty, bearing the legend, ""To my friend Steve,"" is found close to the spot where the cattle were rounded up. A visit to Steve Howard's adobe follows, but Howard's entire ignorance of the entire affair seems to point out his innocence. There can be but one other Steve who could be guilty, and Bronson is hunted up. He is apprised at his sweetheart's home, accused of the theft, and is about to be led away to the lynching tree, when Howard, who has come upon the scene, steps in front of Bronson and shoulders the guilt himself. Bronson is thunderstruck but does not offer to interfere when Howard is led away. He is not quite capable in his black soul of appreciating the nobleness of Howard's sacrifice. On the other hand Howard is firmly convinced that Bronson is innocent and it is to make happy the girl he loves in taking Bronson's place. Bronson, after the party has left, turns to the girl and begs her to go East with him. She consents and goes into the house to pack her suitcase. While she is in the house Parsons, having sold the cattle and returned with the money, calls Bronson aside and tells him he is ready to divide. They are in the midst of this transaction when Kitty comes out of the house and hears them talking about the theft. Immediately she realizes Howard's great sacrifice, for the cowardly knave she has agreed to marry, and in a moment desperately resolves to turn them over to justice and to save Howard's life. They are surprised when they look up into Kitty's revolver, but she forces Bronson to write a confession, clearing Howard, and jumping astride Bronson's horse, gallops off after the sheriff and his posse. She arrives just in the nick of time. The rope has been thrown over Howard's neck and is ready to draw him to his death. The girl's timely arrival prevents this and her screams for them not to hang the man check them. Kitty brings forth the confession from Bronson, Howard is liberated and Kitty goes to his arms.

We see them meet the sandman, who puts them to sleep and laughingly goes on his way, and then we are privileged to be the only ones who see what happens while they sleep. Suddenly the woods beyond them grow light with strange radiance and shining angels with their harps look down upon them and guard their slumbers; and when the night is done and the dawn approaches, we are the only ones who see the troops of fairies that discover them and awaken them with bells of flower cups and trumpets from the honeysuckle. But this is not all, for even though the day has dawned they are not out of danger. Soon we see the terrible old witch, who has finally found them, casting her spell over them and driving them, all unconscious of her presence, through the forest. We see her suddenly stop and hold up her hands and the marvelous house of gingerbread and frosting appears out of the thin air and takes shape before them! We see her put Hansel in a cage to be fattened that she may eat him later on, and then we see, but why tell the rest? Of course, the witch meets her deserts and everything ends happily both for Hansel and Gretel, and for the gingerbread children whom they bring back to life out of the witch's spell. The illusive and imaginative quality of the fairy tale has been fully preserved in this Edison production, and those who have read the story, or who have heard the opera, will find new interest in it and enjoy the original and logical denouement which comes as a surprise at the end.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.9,51,tt0000887,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile the Indian has returned, and finding his squaw gone, realizes the true nature of the situation at finding the sombrero of one of the cowboys in the tepee. Starting in pursuit, he tries to borrow a horse, but is refused, so resorts to running capability to overtake the hounds. The one whose lot it is to take charge of the girl has brutally bound and thrown her across his horse and mounting in the saddle starts for his shack at breakneck speed. Blue Cloud, however, with his knowledge of the trails, by a short cut, and a thrilling dash through the dangerous rapids of the mountain stream, manages to overtake him. Leaping up on the fast galloping horse behind the cowboy, a most exciting combat ensues, a bowie-knife conflict on the back of the horse, with the prostrate form of the squaw flung across its neck. On they gallop, the Indian fighting furiously until at length the cowboy drops lifeless from the saddle. Drawing the horse up, the Indian dismounts and releases the terror-stricken squaw, whom he takes tenderly back to his wigwam.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4ZGVkNjUtM2FmYy00OGU2LWI5OGMtMGFmOTRkZDAzNTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTcwNjUwNzk@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.4,70,tt0000912,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Broncho Billy' Anderson,"The first scene opens on the property of a well-known Western ranchman. A bunch of cow punchers are assembled wasting their time and their employer's money by playing cards. The ranchman catches them at the game, quickly breaks it up, and sends them to work. One cow puncher, a greaser, who dislikes being ordered about, even by his employer, tells the ranchman so. A fight ensues in which the ranchman gets the better of the greaser, and kicks him off the place. After this, the greaser swears revenge. He hits upon a plan, and with the assistance of another greaser they secure the ranchman's little girl, taking with them a shepherd dog, a playmate of the little girl, the dog being utilized later on by the greasers, as the story will show. Eventually the two greasers, the little girl and the dog arrive at the greasers' hut, and a note is written to the little girl's father, stating that she has been taken out of revenge for the treatment the greaser received at the hands of the ranchman and that they will not return her until they feel inclined to do so. The note is tied to the dog, the greaser well knowing that once the dog is released he will make his way back home and that the note will eventually fall into the hands of the little girl's father. The dog is turned loose and hurriedly makes his way home. Immediately upon the finding of the note by the rancher he gathers about him his cow punchers and they start on the trail of the greasers. In order to make sure of locating the girl, the father secures an Indian, who is noted for his ability as a ""trailer."" The Indian is not long in finding the tracks of the fugitives, and he eventually leads the father to the house where his child and her captors are in hiding. A thrilling chase now ensues, and after many startling occurrences the child is returned to her father and the greaser meets a just punishment at the hands of the Indian trailer.",None,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000913,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They come to the farm house of Mr. Graham, where Jessie, his little daughter of 5 years, is playing in the yard. Bill and Liza approach the house and ask for food and money, which is refused by Mrs. Graham. Her husband comes from behind the house at this moment and gruffly orders the gypsies away. They walk off sullenly and a few moments later return and kidnap the little child. The mother soon misses Jessie, suspects the gypsies and Mr. Graham and several neighbors start in pursuit. The gypsies observe the pursuing party. The child is bound and gagged and secreted in a hollow tree, and when the party reaches the camp no trace of the missing child can be found and they return sadly home.

She is sewing as Joe, a young gypsy of her own age, comes along and speaks to her. Bill watches the couple jealously.

Jack goes out into the world, meets and becomes smitten with Miss Dorothy Kirk, a cold, heartless beauty. Dorothy had engaged herself to several worthy young men, but her capriciousness had caused her to throw them aside, so when she is sought by John Hale we feel that she has at last found her affinity. They are engaged and the affinition sealed with a ring, but the usual change of heart comes, and this time on the day of their to-be nuptials, when Jack receives the following note: ""Mr. John Hale, Dear Sir: Am sorry to write I cannot marry you to-day or ever.

Arriving too late in the night to dispose of the gold, he seeks out the pretty daughter of the gambling-house keeper who has given her heart unto his keeping. While waiting for the bank to open in the morning, he becomes fascinated with the sight of the money being won at a gambling table, and starts to gamble with his boss's money. Luck is against him, and scarcely before he realizes it he has lost all. Ruin, disgrace, and prison or lynching stare him in the face. Only seeking to get back what he has lost he tries to rob the gambling house at night, and here he comes face to face with the little girl whom he loves. He confesses to her his crime and shame, and the woman's love spreads forth its hands to shield him. She seeks out Rattlesnake Jim, the Sheriff of Cedar Gulch, who also is in love with her, and implores his aid for her unworthy lover. A warrant for the cowboy's arrest reaches Jim while she is at his cabin and he struggles manfully to follow its mandates to the letter, but his love for the girl causes him to swerve from his strict path of duty and he decides to give the guilty man a fighting chance. Either he or the cowboy must quit Cedar Gulch at once. In other words, one of them must die. To live and not do his duty is a thought that has never entered Jim's mind. So these men of iron and nerve fight a novel duel in the Sheriff's lonely cabin, at which he has ordered the cowboy to report. Baring their arms to the elbow they sit at opposite sides of a table, calmly waiting for a great, poisonous rattlesnake to rise from its bed, which opens in the center of the table, and choose its victim. Slowly it uncoils itself upon the table with fangs darting in and out, it rears its head, the men watching its every move in fearful silence. At a moment when it seems that the awful suspense will be ended by a deadly strike fate interferes, and though justice miscarries, yet Cupid's arrow finds an unsuspecting but not unwilling victim in the person of the lion-hearted Sheriff, whose manly conduct, in contrast with that of her lover, reveals to the girl his true worth.

Jim Flanders, a wealthy ranchman, has a beautiful daughter, Alice, who is loved by Tom Ripley, the foreman of the ranch. The match is objected to by Flanders, who desires his daughter to wed a more cultured and refined man. Ripley is so persistent, however, that Flanders discharges him from his services and orders him to leave the ranch. Robert Gray, an Easterner, and the type of a man, presumably, that Flanders prefers for a son-in-law, is sojourning at the ranch and appears to be desperately in love with Alice. Alice, however, sees through the veneer and Eastern polish of his makeup, and will have nothing to do with him. A climax comes one day shortly after when Ripley again visits the girl and is ordered away by Flanders. A bitter quarrel ensues in which Ripley draws his gun, but he is saved from shooting the ranchman by the timely interference of the other cowboys. Ripley leaves quietly but makes threats which Flanders and a number of cowboys overhear. In a quarrel with one of his employees, Pete, a half-breed, Flanders is shot in the back and Gray, arriving on the scene threatens to expose the Mexican, unless he complies to a certain plan, by which he thinks he can dispose of Ripley and win Alice. The revolver which the half-breed used in shooting his employer is slipped into Ripley's holster and his own removed therefrom. Then an alarm is turned in and a few minutes later Ripley is dragged from his shack and accused of the murder. Evidence is only too strong and speedy Western justice is soon served. Ripley is lynched and Gray finds an open road to the girl's hand. There is a stronger law sometimes than that which is meted out by human hands. ""Remorse,"" that haunting, phantom thing that drives the criminal inevitably to his death, no matter how innocent he may appear in the eyes of the world. Gray wins Alice's consent to marry him, but as he slips on the engagement ring the girl's form melts and in his deluded mind he imagines Ripley is standing in front of him, an accusing finger pointed at him. Gray, uttering a shriek, staggers back, and flees, leaving the astonished girl staring after him. He seeks the solitude of the wilds of a rocky canyon, but the form of Ripley continues to haunt him. A circling eagle high up on the cliff, screams mockingly at him, while the roaring mountain torrent hurls accusations at him. He wends his way with difficulty up the face of the cliff and drops in a heap on the top. Pete, the half-breed, finds him there an hour later. Gray rises and grapples with him. The astonished half-breed struggles, but the superhuman strength of the deluded man crushes all resistance, and a moment later the two totter over the brink to their death on the rocks a thousand feet below.

Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen.

Our story starts with the Colonel and his two nieces starting out to make a short cut to Fort George, accompanied by a scout and piloted by a trusted Indian guide, who was none other than Big Serpent. This traitorous redskin is elated at the opportunity to perpetrate a long cherished revenge. To this effect he has notified his followers and they stand in readiness to act at his call. Proceeding on their journey, they come to a mountain stream, where the party rest and take water, Big Serpent and the scout leading the horses into the shade of the wood. Just prior to the party's arrival, Leather Stocking and Uncas meet, and when they learn Big Serpent is guiding the party, they express their misgivings, being sure of his sinister intention, and truly, for while they are indicating their fears, the scout rushes on and tells that he had been assaulted and the horses killed. Leather Stocking and Uncas volunteer to see the party through their danger, if possible, but they have not proceeded far when the woods seem alive with Indians and the party is almost surrounded. Taking the only avenue of retreat, they manage to reach the stockade just ahead of the bloodthirsty Indians. Here a spirited battle ensues, which is not destined to last long, as ammunition is low. It is hoping against hope, for we now find there are but two charges left, and after that they will be at the mercy of the foe. Leather Stocking, however, feels that there is but one chance, hazardous though it be, of getting to the fort for aid. His plan is subtle in the extreme. Donning an animal's skin, he plunges into the swirly, tortuous river at the back of the stockade, knowing that the crafty Indians would waste no ammunition on game, but save it for the enemy, ammunition being a scarce and precious commodity. In this manner he succeeds in reaching the soldiers' quarters, where he falls, exhausted, after telling them of the danger of the party. The soldiers start off at once, and are none too soon, for in the meantime the Indians have effected an entrance into the stockade with battering rams and have the party tied up to trees, piling brush to incinerate them. The torch is already applied to the brush about Uncas, and only the timely arrival of the soldiers and annihilation of the redskins saves his life. Uncas then accompanies the party on their way to the brow of the bill, where we leave him standing alone, the last of the Mohicans.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.8,20,tt0000934,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They predict the kingship of Macbeth with the words, ""All Hail, King, that shall be hereafter."" They show him a crown, and having also predicted that he shall be created Thane of Cawdor, and that the sons of Banquo shall be Kings of Scotland and not those of Macbeth, the witches fade away, to the utter dismay of the two generals. Then follows a series of very fine tableaux, showing King Duncan conferring upon Macbeth the dignity of Thane of Cawdor, thus verifying the prophesy of the witches, the evil council of Lady Macbeth and the visit of King Duncan to Macbeth's castle, accompanied by his two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, with a numerous retinue. The King is received with gracious smiles by Lady Macbeth, who is still urging her husband to kill him so that they may both attain to royal state. Macbeth's honorable aversion to so foul a deed, and the constant promptings of the wicked Lady Macbeth, are finely portrayed. The murder of the King is finally accomplished by Macbeth, and Lady Macbeth is seen to place the blood-stained dagger in the belt of one of the royal attendants, to divert suspicion. Macbeth is crowned King. The assassination of Banquo follows, and his ghost is seen to appear to Macbeth at the great feast. Macbeth's second consultation with the witches in their cave is shown, and he is told to beware of Macduff, the Thane of Fife, and that he should never be vanquished until the wood of Birnam should move.","None, Italian",Italy,N/A,N/A,N/A,4.8,17,tt0000950,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He played violin for the dancing at many of the East Side balls. Grace, Vivian and Daisy are sisters in a family of the workaday class. Vivian and Daisy are pretty young girls, while Grace is considered homely on account of an ugly scar on her cheek, the result of an accident at her work. The two pretty sisters are great favorites, enjoying social distinction, while drudgery and loneliness is the lot of poor Grace. We see the contrast on Saturday. Vivian and Daisy are getting ready to go to a party, and Grace is allowed to mope at home. Mother, however, urges Grace to go, and helps her to dress in a becoming frock. At the ball Vivian and Daisy are the center of attraction, engaging all the gallants' attention, but Grace remains the wallflower. The ball is over, and the poor girl would be allowed to leave without an escort, but Carl, the blind musician, gropes his way through the hall, and the girl, appreciating his social proscription from the experience of her own sad lot, offers him her hand to lead the way. In that grasp of the hands there is a communion of two pure souls and tender hearts. It is the enkindling of love between them, and they become sweethearts. Shortly afterwards their betrothal is announced, when a young doctor, upon examination, declares that Carl's sight can be restored, but it would require money to have it done, as the services of a specialist would be necessary. Now the poor fellow is more miserable than before, feeling that his cure is possible, yet he is without the necessary funds, as his engagements have only afforded him a bare living, and frugal as he might be he could not hope to accumulate sufficient to pay the doctor. Grace, however, has saved something and is at first elated with the idea to help him, but on viewing herself in the mirror she reasons that when the light comes he will see her as she is and she will then lose his love. Her hesitation is but for a moment, for the true heart is unselfish, and she at least can make him happy. The eminent doctor is employed, and his work is successful. But what a pathetic scene is the removing of the last bandage. He is in the seventh heaven of delight and calls for her. She at first is loath to show herself, fearing the consequences, but he does not consider her personal appearance, which is at best transitory, and which he now sees for the first time, but her heart, the purity of which he has known by intuition.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZiNjA5NzEtZDk5My00OWRhLTljODAtNGU1Y2QyZDQyOThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc1NTUwNjM@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,6.2,111,tt0000935,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Buonaparte, then an impecunious young officer, the subject soon introduces us to Madame Sans Gene, Who brings Napoleon his washing and submits to a kiss. Later, in the laundry itself, her rescue of Count Neupport, whom she assists in a wounded state to her own bedroom, is shown. The girl's lover, Sergeant Le Fevre, forces an entrance, but lets the prisoner go to shield his sweetheart. These scenes all contain much effective acting, as does a later one in which the sergeant is instrumental in saving Napoleon's life. The latter has taken the place of a sentry who has fallen asleep at his post and resting on the latter's ride is waiting for him to wake, when a number of Royalist soldiers attack him. Le Fevre, on his rounds, comes to the rescue and secures a pardon for the sentry and promotion for himself. Le Fevre's rise is rapid. Made a field-marshal, he, after the battle of Danzig, is made a duke for his gallantry in saving the colors. At this stage we are given another glimpse of the heroine, who follows her husband's fortunes in the camp. This period introduces some good scenes of camp life, the council of officers, etc. Back at Paris, we find Napoleon in his private cabinet, unaware of an intrigue in progress in which the Empress is concerned, having for its object the escape of Count Neupport, who is entrusted with a letter to the Emperor of Austria. The Count, however, is discovered in the Court disguised, by Napoleon, and captured and condemned to death. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Danzig has visited Napoleon and laughingly shown him the unpaid laundry bill, and the Little Corporal has shown that he is not insensible to her charms. The Duke and Duchess hear of the capture of the Count and bring about his escape, the nobleman being conveyed through the lines in a military cloak and hat.

We see young Lochinvar, who ""rode out of the West,"" sending one of his retainers disguised as a peddler, to the fair Ellen, who, much against her will, has been betrothed to Douglas. The retainer brings her a message of hope; yet the eve of her forced marriage arrives and no Lochinvar.

After being disarmed he is admitted, and then during the one and last dance which he is permitted to have with Ellen, he suddenly seizes a sword from the wall, takes her in his arms, and before anyone can stop him, breaks one of the high windows and carries her down the castle wall. His swift horse is waiting for him below, and with Ellen in his arms he dashes off, hotly pursued by her father, Douglas and a castle guard. Because his horse is the best in the land, the lovers succeeded in reaching the monastery so far ahead of their pursuers that when the latter arrive the ceremony has been performed and their pursuit is in vain.

Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lever left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown. The lady is moved to commiseration and offers her aid in the gift of the most beautiful gown Veronica has ever seen.

As Jack has already committed that indiscretion it is too late to obey the command so, when Uncle Peter announces that he is coming for himself to see about things, the situation becomes desperate; but Jack is a young man of resource and, despite the fact that Ralph has a wife and baby, he insists upon introducing his bride to Uncle Peter as the lawful spouse of Ralph. Jack's mother-in-law has a constitutional objection to models in her son-in-law's studio, so when she discovers one posing there, Jack sees no way out of the dilemma except to introduce the model as Ralph's wife, thus presenting Ralph with his third spouse. Things might have gone very smoothly under such circumstances, but for the fact that, to Uncle Peter. Ralph must appear to have one wife, and to Jack's mother-in-law, another; and must keep the situation from his own lawful wife. How thoroughly things get mixed when the different members of the families arrive together at the studio can better be told by the film than by words. The denouement is happy, however, as well as hilariously funny. The uncle falls a victim to the charms of Jack's wife and, gallantly accepting the inevitable when he is informed of the true state of affairs, he turns his attention to the model whom he embraces in his enthusiasm. Ralph's wife is pacified too, after an effort, in fact, everybody catches the spirit of the occasion, and joins in the hilarity except the mother-in-law, around whom they all dance ring-o-rosey, to her complete discomfiture.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,tt0000955,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little Bear's worldly possessions are slim, and Great Elk Horn rejects his meager offerings in favor of Standing Rock's rich gifts, and so Rising Moon is taken away by him to his wigwam, where she is left while her husband that is to be goes hunting. Taking advantage of his absence she steals away to the forlorn heart of her own choice, Little Bear, before it is too late. Standing Rock returning and finding her gone at once surmises the truth, and gathering his companions together, starts in pursuit. Little Bear and Rising Moon hearing their approach endeavor to make their escape.

Ranous, Maurice Costello, Hazel Neason","The fourth, and last, of the famous scripts de luxe derived from incidents from Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables."" In this the story is followed from the love of Marius and Cosette to the death of Jean, which ends the volume. M. Marius, grandson of M. Gillenormand, sees Cosette, Jean Valjean's foster-daughter, now grown into a beautiful girl, in the Luxembourg, and falls madly in love with her. Valjean, apprised of the love affair, refuses to give his consent, and Marius induces Cosette to marry him without parental sanction. Meanwhile Thenardier, once the keeper of the Inn of the Soldier of Waterloo at Montfermeil, but now reduced to dire straits in Paris, recognizes in a benevolent old man the visitor to the inn who removed the child Cosette and who must be the escaped convict, Jean Valjean. Playing upon his sympathy, Thenardier induces Jean to visit his apartment, and Marius, who occupies the next room because a quarrel with his grandfather has reduced him to want, overhears a part of the plot and rescues Jean by warning the police. Jean makes his escape and next encounters Marius at the barricade, where he releases Javert, the human bloodhound, who, through a score of years, has remorselessly hunted Jean. Gavriche, the gamin, is there, enjoying the battle until his brave sortie to rifle the cartouche boxes of the dead soldiers brings to an end his gay life and finds for him a place beside his dead sister, Eponine, whose love for Marius has led her to assume a boy's dress and follow him to the barricade. Jean learns of Marius's relations with Cosette and when the regulars carry the barricade he makes his escape into the sewer with the unconscious man upon his back. In the sewer he encounters Thenardier, who permits him to escape from the locked gate by means of a false key, at the same time cutting from Marius's trousers a portion of one leg as a means of identification. Later Thenardier's attempt to blackmail Marius clears away the cloud of suspicion that has hovered over Jean in Marius's mind, and he and Cosette hurry to Jean, whom they find dying of starvation and heartbreak, but happy at the sight of Cosette once more.

As Mrs. Ross is dressed and ready to attend an afternoon tea at Mrs. Parker's, this forced absence of the nurse is very inopportune. However, little Alice.

Effie wisely chose Dave, and we see the happy couple returning from their wedding and starting in on a happy, simple life. Dave and Effie romp about the fields, among the cows and sheep, like a couple of wild children. Dave is comfortably situated and is able to provide his wife a pleasant though modest home. For five years they are happy indeed, a little child coming in the meantime to shed an extra ray of sunshine, but, alas! The tempter appears in the person of Woodson, who returns, and with honeyed, flattering tongue poisons the mind of Effie and makes the grind of simple life decidedly irksome. Repeated entreaties on his part make the poor woman drift into the wrong path so far as to listen to his persuasion. At length she almost decides to go away with him, but later she struggles against the inclination until a note telling her he will be at the old bridge to take her with him decides her. Leaving a note of farewell for her husband on the table, she goes to the place of meeting. She has hardly left when baby, finding the letter and innocently taking it up, follows on, guided as if by the hand of Providence.

For ever since the beginning we have harkened to the injunction. ""And a little child shall lead them."" It is needless to add that the woman sees clearly the error of her way and recoils before it is too late, leaving Woodson standing in the road, perturbed and chagrined.

Hulda, the Swedish maid, is deeply smitten with the young writer, and is grieved at his misfortune. An idea seizes her. She has saved some money, so she takes his rejected manuscript to the publisher and begs that he accept it and pay for it with her money. This the editor indignantly refuses to do, but her sincere, simple manner appeals to him, so he at length consents to consider it sufficiently as to read it. It is a surprise to him, being possessed of such rare merit, that he sends a check to Woodson, with word that he will be glad to consider anything else he may write. Woodson is at a loss to know what caused their change of attitude, until the editor tells him of the Swedish girl's visit. He also realizes who had left financial assistance on his table anonymously, for which he gave the landlady's daughter credit.

John was a bighearted, indulgent husband whose every thought was for his wife's happiness, and while Louise was a devoted wife, still there was the strain of selfishness ever apparent, for she who studies her glass neglects her heart. She yearned for ostentation, and poor John was in no position to appease this desire. However, an occasion presents itself when they can at least bask in the radiance of the social limelight, in an invitation to attend a reception tendered a foreign prince. John is in the height of elation, hut Louise meets him with that time-honored remark, ""I've nothing to wear."" Well, he feels the strength of her argument, so goes and pawns his watch and chain to procure her a gown fitting for the occasion. The gown emphasizes the absence of jewel ornamentation, so they visit their friend and neighbor, who lends them a handsome necklace. At the reception she makes quite a stir and is presented to the prince, who becomes decidedly attentive. Arriving home after the affair, Louise rehearses the incidents of the event, when suddenly she stands petrified with horror. ""My God! The necklace is gone."" High and low they search, and even back to the ballroom, but without result, for we have seen it stolen from her neck by a sneak thief while she is talking with the prince. Unable to find the necklace, they swear to give their fingers to the bone, their life's blood until it is paid for. But then there is the humiliation of not returning the jewels, so they hunt for a duplicate. At the jeweler's they find one, in appearance an exact copy, but the price is $20,000. Twenty thousand dollars to ones in their condition meant a large fortune. However, John borrows money on his salary, gets loans from his various friends and is granted a large advance by his employer, giving notes for same: in fact, mortgaging his very life as the result of vanity. With the money he purchases the duplicate and gives it to their friend, who is unaware of the substitution. Meanwhile, the thief has taken the necklace to a pawnshop and finds it is a worthless imitation, and so throws it into the rubbish heap. Five years later we find the couple toiling, toiling, but still in bondage; after night in the endeavor to make a little extra above his ordinary salary. Ten years we find them, still hounded by the note collectors, aged and broken in health, yet determined. Twenty years, and the last penny on the necklace is paid, but at the expense of their bodily strength. Having cleared up his debt with his employer, he is discharged, being too feeble to do the work. As a last resort they write to their friend, confessing the substitution of the jewels, and their plight as a result, begging that she give them some slight assistance. Their friend, of course, is amazed, she cognizant of the worthlessness of her property, so hastens to give Louise back the jewels, arriving only in time to put them about her neck when she sinks back dead.

Griffith,"Florence Lawrence, Anita Hendrie, Anthony O'Sullivan","The pretty little romance which forms the plot of this subject shows one of the subtle ways Cupid has in bringing about the affined condition in two hearts entirely unlooked for. Ella Berlins is engaged as a shoe packer at the Lone Star Shoe Factory, and by way of a lark, and egged on by her companions, writes a note of usual type and places it in the lining of a shoe. The shoe is one of a consignment to a retailer, and falls into the hands of one of his best customers, although an awful grouch. In a fury he returns the shoes with what he considers an insulting note, and declares he will buy his shoes elsewhere in the future. The dealer is at first inclined to feel amused over the incident, but when he realizes the loss be suffers, he at once writes of the affair to the manufacturer. The result is that Ella is called before the proprietor and fired. However, her sweet, innocent face makes such an impression on the proprietor that he reconsiders her dismissal and she returns to work. He now sees her often as she busies herself among the others packing shoes, and the more he sees her the more impressed he becomes, until at length, well, she is simply out of place as far as he is concerned, and with some trumped up offense she is fired again. Sorrowfully she goes home and to her mother's query as to why she was discharged she has no answer for she does not know. She can simply sigh forth the time-worn expression, ""1 didn't do anything."" While they are sorrowing there is a knock, and mother answers, opening the door to the boss. He enters sternly and starts in to scold Ella unsparingly, finishing by saying that as a shoe packer she is an awful failure, but as his wife she, he knew, would be the greatest kind of success. ""Now, who'd a thought it?""","None, English",USA,N/A,N/A,N/A,5.2,16,tt0000985,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Life of Moliere,1910,N/A,29 Oct 1910,20 min,"Short, Biography, Drama",Léonce Perret,"Louis Feuillade, Abel Gance","André Bacqué, Abel Gance, René d'Auchy","We first see Moliere at work in his father's shop, when a boy. All the employees are busy at their appointed tasks, except the youthful playwright, who snatches time to re-read one of his earliest efforts. The door opens and the Italian comedian, Scaramouche, enters in quest of a particular style of chair. Moliere tenders his play for perusal; but, just as Scaramouche begins to be interested, Poquelin, the father of Moliere, comes in unexpectedly and the play is hastily thrown out of sight. Again the boy poet places it in the comedian's hand, and some clever work is done by Scaramouche, as he tries to read the manuscript without being detected by the stern upholsterer. The next scene shows Moliere at the Louvre palace, where he meets Louis XIV for the first time. Here we see the scorn of the courtiers for the actor-dramatist and the consideration shown for him by the King. This scene will be remembered for the delicate beauty of the interiors shown. Next we view the stately splendor of the festival at Versailles, where hundreds of courtiers, ladies in waiting and great nobles attend on Louis XIV. The beauty of the court costumes, which set the fashion for all the royal houses in Europe at that time, and the courtly air and demeanor of every individual in the royal pageant, have been faithfully reproduced. One cannot but marvel at the excellence of the training of this vast throng, every one of whom acts his or her part as if manor-born. We must take off our hats to this Gaumont producer. As Moliere comes into the scene, the acting of the King, the courtiers and of the great actor himself, is faultless. When the King places his arm around Moliere's shoulders and walks off with him, it is a delight to watch the faces of the surprised and jealous train of followers. And when next we see Louis seated at table with Moliere, serving him with his own hands, the cup of the courtiers is full. The scene showing the distraction of Moliere over the desertion of his wife is a pathetic picture and displays talented emotional acting. Then, when she appears before finally leaving him, and we watch the play of coquetry on her witching face and note her charm of manner and grace of deportment, we do not wonder at poor Moliere's abandonment to despair. The attempt of the faithful maid servant to arouse Moliere from his apathy and melancholia is a brilliant specimen of silent acting in both roles. The last appearance of Moliere, and his first in the role of Malade, is a fine depiction of the stage of the tennis court theater and of the French manner of acting a part in the seventeenth century. Then follow his sudden illness and death.",None,France,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExZjBhYzItOWQ5OS00NGUwLTljMTktMDFjNWUzNWFkODA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,5.8,83,tt0000970,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the Little Big Horn or Custer's Last Stand,1909,N/A,25 Nov 1909,N/A,"Short, Action, Drama",Francis Boggs,N/A,"Hobart Bosworth, Betty Harte, Frank Walsh","The order of disarmament, issued in the Winter of 1S74, and the arrest of ""Rain in the Face"" by young Tom Custer, is shown in our first three scenes. Then, ""two years later,"" we witness the arrival of General Custer at Post Fort Lincoln. An order superseding him in command of the expedition is received. Then follows a scene where the officers beg him not to trust ""Reno"" with an important command, as it was known in the army that bad blood existed between these two officers. A bit of unwritten history is here introduced. The Commander of the Post, Col. Godfrey, had a pretty daughter, Dollie, who was in love with Lieut. Glenn, one of Custer's subalterns, and she, not relishing being separated from her sweetheart, inadvertently learned that there was to be an officer sent back to bring forward a supply train as soon as the General located the Indians. She makes a written request asking the General to send back Lieut. Glenn. The love interest bearing upon the lives of these two young people is, we hope, not intrusively blended into and made a part of the, present historical subject. We then see General Custer and his officers watching the hostiles through their field glasses. Custer decides to attack. Reno is given command of the supporting column, in spite of the protests of the assembled officers. The General thinks of little Dollie Godfrey's letter, reads it, grants the request it contains by ordering young Lieut. Glenn back to the fort. Next we see the wily ""Rain in the Face"" and his band of naked, painted devils leading Custer's cavalry into a trap; riding up just out of gunshot, they tantalize Custer into making a charge. The ""Gallant Command"" answer the order with a yell and are off after the fleeing band of savages. A sudden dip in the prairie and the Indians disappear, then up a rise of ground perhaps thirty feet in height; then come the soldiers, every man urging his horse to his utmost in order to gain on the yelling red fiends in front. Over the bluff they go, and the sight that meets their gaze freezes the blood, for stretched away as far as the eye can reach, upright and naked on their ponies they sit, three thousand Sioux warriors, waiting for the handful of white soldiers to be brought to the slaughter. Too late, Custer sees his error; nothing daunted, he gives the order, column half left, about face, retreat, steady, men, ride for your lives to higher ground; then two miles away Reno's officers hear the volley that greets Custer from that bronze line, and beg him, Reno, to go to Custer's assistance. Then we see ""The Last Stand""; horses sent to the rear to be later stampeded, thus leaving no escape for the brave little band, now reduced to forty-one men; the red circle of death closes in about them and ""Rain in the Face"" is avenged. Two days later the news reaches Fort Lincoln. On the same day a young officer, dust covered, his uniform in shreds, rides into the Fort and delivers Custer's last message, sent a few hours before the massacre. Glenn had fallen into the hands of a roving band of Sioux, but makes his escape and reaches the Fort, to learn for the first time the fate of his comrades on the Little Big Horn.","None, English",United States,N/A,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NjMjU4ZjQtMTJhYi00Njg4LTg5ZmMtMDllM2RjODdiOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,N/A,4.8,5,tt0000991,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One Touch of Nature,1909,N/A,01 Jan 1909,10 min,"Short, Drama",D.W. Griffith,Stanner E.V. Taylor,"Arthur V. Johnson, Florence Lawrence, Marion Leonard","Policeman John Murray is the proud father of a little girl and the happy husband of a dutiful wife. Both father's and mother's whole life is centered in their little one, and the little family are as happy as can be until death tears the baby from them. As the child's soul leaves its body, so the poor heart-broken mother's reason leaves her. What an awful blow to Murray. The loss of his child was indeed hard to bear, but his dear wife hurled into a living death was worse. A trained nurse must be her constant companion, and the poor woman spent her time fondling the dolls and playthings of her lost one. Murray's beat lay in the tenderloin section of the city, and many curious characters came under his notice. In the cellar under a junk shop there lived, or rather existed, a Sicilian couple of the very lowest type, who eked an existence by begging and theft. A little orphan girl fell into their keeping and they forced her to beg on the street for them, beating her into submission if she refused, which the child's proud spirit inclined her to do. Out in the snow storm, thinly clad, the poor child was made to stand at the stage doors of the theaters or in front of saloons to work upon the sympathy of the generous-hearted habitués. She was always accompanied by the Sicilian woman, who took good care that she didn't escape. Murray, on his rounds, runs into them and his suspicions are aroused, so he follows them and enters their hovel just in time to see the poor creature receiving a frightful beating. With a terrific blow he sends the man reeling to the floor and hurling the woman on top of him he seizes the child in his arms. At this moment a couple of his squad, in answer to his whistle, enter and take the Sicilians in charge. An idea dawns on him. He takes the little one home and presents her to his poor demented wife. The presence of the child at once restores her reason, so the clouds of sorrow are dissipated and happiness reigns. The picture presents a moral showing the singular working of God's justice in taking to Himself an unsullied soul that another might be saved.","None, English",United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,6.5,18,tt0000995,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
